Throughout the formalization, I tried to rigorously follow Prof. Russell’s proof, with no or little added statements from my side, which were only necessary for the formalization but not the logical argument. Should you notice any inaccuracy (even if it does not necessarily falsify the proof), please let me know as I would like to proceed with the same spirit of rigour. Before starting this project, I had already found Prof. Elkind’s formalization of the Principia using Rocq (formerly Coq), which is much mature work than this one. However, I still thought it would be fun to do it using Lean4.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndrwnaguib.com&#x2F;principia&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndrwnaguib.com&#x2F;principia&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndrwnaguib&#x2F;principia\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndrwnaguib&#x2F;principia</a>",

This took way too much time (about an hour for each of the few books I made and tested with family and friends). It clearly wasn&#x27;t possible to release this version because I’d be losing a huge amount of time on every order. So instead, I decided I&#x27;d finish off the project as best I could, put it &quot;on ice,&quot; and wait for the API release.<p>The API is now released (quicker than I thought it&#x27;d be, too!) and I integrated it last night. I&#x27;d love your feedback on any and all aspects.<p>The market is mostly family-based, but from my testing of the physical book I&#x27;ve found that both adults and kids enjoy coloring them in (it&#x27;s surprisingly cathartic and creative). If you would like to order one you can get 10% off by tapping the total price line item five times.",

If you&#x27;ve tried any of them, you know they&#x27;re slow, expensive, and inconsistent. That&#x27;s why we built an agent specifically for running test cases and optimized it just for that:<p>- Pure vision instead of error prone &quot;set-of-marks&quot; system (the colorful boxes you see in browser-use for example)<p>- Use tiny VLM (Moondream) instead of OpenAI&#x2F;Anthropic computer use for dramatically faster and cheaper execution<p>- Use two agents: one for planning and adapting test cases and one for executing them quickly and consistently.<p>The idea is the planner builds up a general plan which the executor runs. We can save this plan and re-run it with only the executor for quick, cheap, and consistent runs. When something goes wrong, it can kick back out to the planner agent and re-adjust the test.<p>It’s completely open source. Would love to have more people try it out and tell us how we can make it great.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnitudedev&#x2F;magnitude\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnitudedev&#x2F;magnitude</a>",

      "text": "Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Lemon Slice. We’ve trained a custom diffusion transformer (DiT) model that achieves video streaming at 25fps and wrapped it into a demo that allows anyone to turn a photo into a real-time, talking avatar. Here’s an example conversation from co-founder Andrew: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CeYp5xQMFZY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CeYp5xQMFZY</a>. Try it for yourself at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live</a>.<p>(Btw, we used to be called Infinity AI and did a Show HN under that name last year: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41467704\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41467704</a>.)<p>Unlike existing avatar video chat platforms like HeyGen, Tolan, or Apple Memoji filters, we do not require training custom models, rigging a character ahead of time, or having a human drive the avatar. Our tech allows users to create and immediately video-call a custom character by uploading a single image. The character image can be any style - from photorealistic to cartoons, paintings, and more.<p>To achieve this demo, we had to do the following (among other things! but these were the hardest):<p>1. Training a fast DiT model. To make our video generation fast, we had to both design a model that made the right trade-offs between speed and quality, and use standard distillation approaches. We first trained a custom video diffusion transformer (DiT) from scratch that achieves excellent lip and facial expression sync to audio. To further optimize the model for speed, we applied teacher-student distillation. The distilled model achieves 25fps video generation at 256-px resolution. Purpose-built transformer ASICs will eventually allow us to stream our video model at 4k resolution.<p>2. Solving the infinite video problem. Most video DiT models (Sora, Runway, Kling) generate 5-second chunks. They can iteratively extend it by another 5sec by feeding the end of the 1st chunk into the start of the 2nd in an autoregressive manner. Unfortunately the models experience quality degradation after multiple extensions due to accumulation of generation errors. We developed a temporal consistency preservation technique that maintains visual coherence across long sequences. Our technique significantly reduces artifact accumulation and allows us to generate indefinitely-long videos.<p>3. A complex streaming architecture with minimal latency. Enabling an end-to-end avatar zoom call requires several building blocks, including voice transcription, LLM inference, and text-to-speech generation in addition to video generation. We use Deepgram as our AI voice partner. Modal as the end-to-end compute platform. And Daily.co and Pipecat to help build a parallel processing pipeline that orchestrates everything via continuously streaming chunks. Our system achieves end-to-end latency of 3-6 seconds from user input to avatar response. Our target is &lt;2 second latency.<p>More technical details here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;technical-report\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;technical-report</a>.<p>Current limitations that we want to solve include: (1) enabling whole-body and background motions (we’re training a next-gen model for this), (2) reducing delays and improving resolution (purpose-built ASICs will help), (3) training a model on dyadic conversations so that avatars learn to listen naturally, and (4) allowing the character to “see you” and respond to what they see to create a more natural and engaging conversation.<p>We believe that generative video will usher in a new media type centered around interactivity: TV shows, movies, ads, and online courses will stop and talk to us. Our entertainment will be a mixture of passive and active experiences depending on what we’re in the mood for. Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future, but that’s how we see it anyway!<p>We’d love for you to try out the demo and let us know what you think! Post your characters and&#x2F;or conversation recordings below.",

But giving full access to your host device is risky. What if the agent&#x27;s process gets compromised, or the LLM hallucinates and leaks your data? And practically speaking, do you really want to give up control of your entire machine just so the agent can do its job?<p>The idea behind c&#x2F;ua is simple: let agents operate in a mirror of the user’s system - isolated, secure, and disposable - so users can fire-and-forget complex tasks without needing to dedicate their entire system to the agent. By running in a virtualized environment, agents can carry out their work without interrupting your workflow or risking the integrity of your system.<p>While exploring this idea, I discovered Apple’s Virtualization.Framework and realized it offered fast and lightweight virtualization on Apple Silicon. This led us to build a high-performance virtualization layer and, eventually, a computer-use interface that allows agents to interact with apps just like a human would - without taking over the entire system.<p>As we built this, we decided to open-source the virtualization core as a standalone CLI tool called Lume (Show HN here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061</a>). c&#x2F;ua builds on top of Lume, providing a full framework for running agent workflows inside secure macOS or Linux VMs, so your system stays free for you to use while the agent works its magic in the background.<p>With Cua you can build an AI agent within a virtual environment to: - navigate and interact with any application&#x27;s interface; - read screen content and perform keyboard&#x2F;mouse actions; - switch between applications and self-debug when needed; - operate in a secure sandbox with controlled file access. All of this occurs in a fully isolated environment, ensuring your host system, files, and sensitive data remain completely secure, while you continue using your device without interruption.<p>People are using c&#x2F;ua to: - Bypass CryptoJS-based encryption and anti-bot measures to interact with modern web apps reliably; - Automate Tableau dashboards and export insights via Claude Desktop; - Drive Photoshop for batch image editing by prompt; - Modify 3D models in Fusion 360 with a CAD Copilot; -Extract data from legacy ERP apps without brittle screen‑scraping scripts.<p>We’re currently working on multi‑VM orchestration for parallel agentic workflows, Windows and Linux VM support, and episodic and long-term memory for CUA Agents.<p>On the open‑source side, c&#x2F;ua is 100 % free under the MIT license - run it locally with any LLM you like. We’re also gearing up a hosted orchestration service for teams who want zero‑ops setup (early access sign‑ups opening soon).<p>We’d love to hear from you. What desktop or legacy apps do you wish you could automate? Any thoughts, feedback, or horror stories from fragile AI automations are more than welcome!",

Here&#x27;s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wp1hoSCEArg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wp1hoSCEArg</a><p>As a heavy Notion user, I often found it tough to get my teams fully onboard since people naturally gravitate toward chat for quick interactions. Maintaining context between chat apps like Slack and documentation apps like Notion became increasingly frustrating. Switching contexts, losing track of information, and managing data across multiple tools created unnecessary friction.<p>This frustration led me to build Colanode, a single platform integrating structured notes and knowledge management with real-time chat. After building the first version, early feedback highlighted a critical issue: teams&#x2F;organizations want full control over sensitive data, especially conversations. That&#x27;s why I decided to open-source Colanode under an Apache 2.0 license, making it fully self-hostable so you can retain complete ownership and privacy over your data.<p>Colanode is built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, using only open-source tools and avoiding any vendor or cloud lock-in. It features a local-first architecture offering complete offline support. From a technical perspective, Colanode consists of a Node.js server API and an Electron desktop client, with mobile apps coming soon. Everything in Colanode is represented as a node (e.g., message, file, folder, chat, channel, database, record), each with specific attributes and permissions. All reads and writes performed by the desktop client happen locally within a SQLite database, and changes sync seamlessly via a synchronization engine built on top of SQLite, Postgres, and Yjs—a CRDT library for conflict resolution. The server then propagates these changes to other collaborators. You can self-host the server in any environment using Docker, Postgres, Redis, and any S3-compatible storage, and connect using the official desktop client, which supports simultaneous connections to multiple servers and accounts. This local-first approach also prepares us for future integrations with fully local LLMs, further enhancing privacy and performance.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback and suggestions on Colanode. What features would you like to see? What would you change?<p>Thanks, looking forward to your thoughts!",

If you’ve ever highlighted sections in a physical book and wanted to save or organize them digitally, SnipFast can help.<p>This came from my own frustration. I like to note down ideas when reading, but doing that from physical books was time-consuming. I looked for a tool to solve this, didn’t find one, so I built it.<p>SnipFast lets you:<p>- Automatically detect and extract highlighted text from a page photo (works with most highlighter pens and languages)<p>- Click on sentences in the image to manually pick exactly what you want to copy<p>It’s aimed at readers, students, researchers - basically anyone who annotates physical books and wants to keep those notes digitally.<p>Under the hood, it uses a custom ML model trained on highlight detection. The app runs on a Kotlin backend with a Postgres database. You can try it for free. Signup is required, but it’s minimal. I offer some credits upfront so people can test it out. After that, there’s a small payment required. The goal is mainly to prevent abuse and to validate whether this is a tool people find valuable enough to pay for.<p>The UI still needs work, and I’m mainly looking for feedback at this stage. I’d love to hear: does this solve a real problem for you? Was anything confusing? What would make it more useful?<p>link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snipfa.st\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snipfa.st</a><p>Thanks,\nTom",
