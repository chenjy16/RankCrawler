      "text": "When you have a lot of aliases it can be difficult to remember how was the one you need named especially if you do not use it very often. You can also have files stored in a bin folder and look there to find the name. Another trick is to prepend your commands with a comma then type the comma and hit the Tab key to see only your own commands. There is an article about it somewhere on the Internet.<p>I needed something lightweight to always show me the available commands. Something to run with a few keystrokes. Something that stores commands in files and folder structures.<p>The idea was born at the time of using Linux Debian with the dwm (dynamic window manager). The first version was implemented in bash and it could do three things: start an application, expand text from a template and do a predefined automation on the selected application.<p>It was launched by a keyboard shortcut and opened the list of commands in a new terminal window. The commands were stored in nested folders and it was able to switch between the three modes (launcher, expander, automator). It also required only few keystrokes to do the desired action.<p>For instance, I was in the terminal and hit Ctrl+P. It opened a new terminal and listed applications to launch. I hit the Space to switch to the expander mode. Then I hit the g to enter the Git folder and s for the status. The result was that it put the git status to the terminal I was in before. This expander could be used in any application. It could insert the email template into the browser.<p>Then I migrated to macOS and really missed that tool. So I quickly wrote a zsh vesrion that consists only the expander mode and supports only the terminal. It is activated by hitting Enter on empty command and then it inserts the desired command right into the prompt. For example, when you hit Enter, g and s you will get the git status command to the prompt and you can then execute it with Enter. Of course, those commands and keys are defined by you. There are various and lenghty commands that I use on a daily basis like this and it saves a lot of typing.<p>The tool is called Empty Enter Expander. It is implemented for the zsh as of now. Please check it out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;waszabi&#x2F;empty-enter-expander\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;waszabi&#x2F;empty-enter-expander</a> and let me know what you like or dislike about it.",

After being invited to the first fantasy league and seeing the platform they were using, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to check it every day. An excel sheet would have been more appealing to use than this.<p>So I decided to create my own. But on the side? This would take ages. I am very confident with Rust and JavaScript, but it still takes ages to build something like that.<p>Good prompts, and a few long nights later, and I could create something fun and easy to use.<p>Have a look:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fantasy-frontend.fly.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fantasy-frontend.fly.dev&#x2F;</a><p>The frontend is in React, the backend in Rust. I deployed both via fly.io. It was so simple and fast, it was shocking.<p>After it was deployed, I took 2-3 days to refactor everything and made it neat and tidy, so I could possibly open it up for general use with accounts etc.<p>The first time I built something with the help of AI not just for me.<p>The biggest help was certainly the UI and styling. I was never good at that. The first draft looked rough. I fed it some screenshots from NHL.com and told the model to &quot;make it look nicer&quot;. What you see is I think the 20th iteration of the app, slowly improving, fixing bugs etc. But 90% with the help of AI.<p>I could have done 98% myself (except the styling part). And after each working iteration, I spend quite some time cleaning up so I can  build on top of that.<p>The beauty? The cleaner, more modular code base saved tokens and made it easier for the model to refactor and understand. Strictly typed (TypeScritp in the frontend, Rust in the backend) helped as well!",

Throughout the formalization, I tried to rigorously follow Prof. Russell’s proof, with no or little added statements from my side, which were only necessary for the formalization but not the logical argument. Should you notice any inaccuracy (even if it does not necessarily falsify the proof), please let me know as I would like to proceed with the same spirit of rigour. Before starting this project, I had already found Prof. Elkind’s formalization of the Principia using Rocq (formerly Coq), which is much mature work than this one. However, I still thought it would be fun to do it using Lean4.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndrwnaguib.com&#x2F;principia&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndrwnaguib.com&#x2F;principia&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndrwnaguib&#x2F;principia\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndrwnaguib&#x2F;principia</a>",

This took way too much time (about an hour for each of the few books I made and tested with family and friends). It clearly wasn&#x27;t possible to release this version because I’d be losing a huge amount of time on every order. So instead, I decided I&#x27;d finish off the project as best I could, put it &quot;on ice,&quot; and wait for the API release.<p>The API is now released (quicker than I thought it&#x27;d be, too!) and I integrated it last night. I&#x27;d love your feedback on any and all aspects.<p>The market is mostly family-based, but from my testing of the physical book I&#x27;ve found that both adults and kids enjoy coloring them in (it&#x27;s surprisingly cathartic and creative). If you would like to order one you can get 10% off by tapping the total price line item five times.",

If you&#x27;ve tried any of them, you know they&#x27;re slow, expensive, and inconsistent. That&#x27;s why we built an agent specifically for running test cases and optimized it just for that:<p>- Pure vision instead of error prone &quot;set-of-marks&quot; system (the colorful boxes you see in browser-use for example)<p>- Use tiny VLM (Moondream) instead of OpenAI&#x2F;Anthropic computer use for dramatically faster and cheaper execution<p>- Use two agents: one for planning and adapting test cases and one for executing them quickly and consistently.<p>The idea is the planner builds up a general plan which the executor runs. We can save this plan and re-run it with only the executor for quick, cheap, and consistent runs. When something goes wrong, it can kick back out to the planner agent and re-adjust the test.<p>It’s completely open source. Would love to have more people try it out and tell us how we can make it great.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnitudedev&#x2F;magnitude\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnitudedev&#x2F;magnitude</a>",

But giving full access to your host device is risky. What if the agent&#x27;s process gets compromised, or the LLM hallucinates and leaks your data? And practically speaking, do you really want to give up control of your entire machine just so the agent can do its job?<p>The idea behind c&#x2F;ua is simple: let agents operate in a mirror of the user’s system - isolated, secure, and disposable - so users can fire-and-forget complex tasks without needing to dedicate their entire system to the agent. By running in a virtualized environment, agents can carry out their work without interrupting your workflow or risking the integrity of your system.<p>While exploring this idea, I discovered Apple’s Virtualization.Framework and realized it offered fast and lightweight virtualization on Apple Silicon. This led us to build a high-performance virtualization layer and, eventually, a computer-use interface that allows agents to interact with apps just like a human would - without taking over the entire system.<p>As we built this, we decided to open-source the virtualization core as a standalone CLI tool called Lume (Show HN here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061</a>). c&#x2F;ua builds on top of Lume, providing a full framework for running agent workflows inside secure macOS or Linux VMs, so your system stays free for you to use while the agent works its magic in the background.<p>With Cua you can build an AI agent within a virtual environment to: - navigate and interact with any application&#x27;s interface; - read screen content and perform keyboard&#x2F;mouse actions; - switch between applications and self-debug when needed; - operate in a secure sandbox with controlled file access. All of this occurs in a fully isolated environment, ensuring your host system, files, and sensitive data remain completely secure, while you continue using your device without interruption.<p>People are using c&#x2F;ua to: - Bypass CryptoJS-based encryption and anti-bot measures to interact with modern web apps reliably; - Automate Tableau dashboards and export insights via Claude Desktop; - Drive Photoshop for batch image editing by prompt; - Modify 3D models in Fusion 360 with a CAD Copilot; -Extract data from legacy ERP apps without brittle screen‑scraping scripts.<p>We’re currently working on multi‑VM orchestration for parallel agentic workflows, Windows and Linux VM support, and episodic and long-term memory for CUA Agents.<p>On the open‑source side, c&#x2F;ua is 100 % free under the MIT license - run it locally with any LLM you like. We’re also gearing up a hosted orchestration service for teams who want zero‑ops setup (early access sign‑ups opening soon).<p>We’d love to hear from you. What desktop or legacy apps do you wish you could automate? Any thoughts, feedback, or horror stories from fragile AI automations are more than welcome!",
