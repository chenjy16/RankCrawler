Members of the community have released integrations for Playnite (Windows), muOS (Anbernic handhelds) and Decky Loader (Steam Deck), with many more in the works.<p>The team has been working on RomM for just over two years now, and we&#x27;re incredibly proud of what we&#x27;ve built so far. There&#x27;s no company behind the project, just a bunch of friends building something together that we&#x27;ve wanted for a long time. And of course, the code is open-source and AGPLv3 licensed.<p>Check out the (kinda slow) demo running on an ultra-cheap VPS: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.romm.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.romm.app&#x2F;</a>",

See what it can do here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;xNyPKJZI400\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;xNyPKJZI400</a> (demos are sped up as shown in the video)<p>I’ve spent a few years building RC planes (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyo.ng&#x2F;hangar&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyo.ng&#x2F;hangar&#x2F;</a>) and micro gas turbines (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;set.mit.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;set.mit.edu</a>), and I’ve always wished hardware were cheaper so more people could experiment.<p>I’m now launching a $219 desktop robot-arm kit that keeps LeRobot SO-101’s kinematics, swaps key parts for sturdier, more precise SLA prints, and adds two integrated 480 p cameras. After plenty of supplier haggling, the whole kit costs less than the twelve servos alone. I’ll release the updated mechanical design under an MIT license by June 30.<p>On the software side, I&#x27;ll also release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30 that exposes the local robot policy as tools for agentic LLMs (Opus 4, o3, etc.) to use in long-horizon tasks. Here&#x27;s how it works: You can teach the robot new skills through teleoperation. During inference, you simply talk to the agentic LLM using natural language instructions. The LLM then calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically decomposing your high-level requests into executable robot commands.<p>Thanks to the LeRobot community for making such an amazing robot accessible. If you’ve contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon as a small thank-you.<p>I’d love your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, cleaning up the codebase, and writing docs, I’m considering: a force-controlled gripper, a parallel-jaw gripper, an extra wrist DOF (matching the new Trossen and ARX arms), full force feedback on the leader arm (though that may triple the price), a more affordable version with lower resolution each joint, and a longer-reach variant. Which of these—or something else—would be most useful to you?<p>You can order it here if you want: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-l...</a>.

I hope we can have your business in the future.)<p>Looking forward to any and all comments!<p>---<p>Edit: A quick explanation regarding shipping times (as stated on our shop page):<p>• The first batch of 20 units, which will be shipped by June 30, is sold out.<p>• The second batch of 100 units will be shipped by July 15 (unassembled kits) and July 21 (assembled units). The order limit is to ensure we can ship on time and maintain high quality.<p>For those who have already placed orders: I will reach out individually to ask if you would like to receive weekly progress updates from now until the shipping date.",

We build AI agents that handle repetitive administrative tasks in healthcare clinics like filling out intake forms, prepping charts, or managing referrals.<p>We were early employees at Forward, which provided primary care across the US. To scale this, we relied on thousands of remote contractors to do repetitive administrative work like reconciling patient records, and scheduling follow-ups based on care plans. It was a huge bottleneck—expensive, error-prone, and always pulling attention away from clinical care. Our software solutions were always too brittle, never managing to handle the variance of clinical data we oversaw.<p>AI, when applied well, is capable of performing a lot of the tasks we manually did. So we decided to take another crack at the problem by building today what we would have liked to have back then, and to help clinics use it.<p>Clinics send us their SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures—for example, “prep a patient chart from these records before a visit”), and we turn them into AI agents that do the work. These agents act like remote contractors: they log into EHRs, navigate internal tools, and do the work in the background. Unlike classical RPA, we build in verification and deterministic checks, so customers can confirm it was done right. \nUnlike low-code tools, there’s nothing new to learn. Customers don’t have to touch a UI or maintain logic. They just hand us the task, and we do it. Clinicians don’t want more screens! They erode attention and cause weird bottlenecks in operations because someone has to drive them. Our product is built to address this.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g</a>. We’re not self-serve yet, but we deploy with customers in days after onboarding them. We’re working on speeding that up.<p>One of our early customers is a fast-growing obesity medicine group. Their MAs were spending 15 to 20 minutes per patient just entering intake form data into the EHR. That one task was taking up 30% of their MA time. We took it over in a week. It’s now fully automated, and they’ve cleared the backlog and sped up visits.<p>A few technical problems are specifically relevant to building healthcare agents:<p>- Unreliable interfaces: many EHRs and clinic tools don’t follow modern web standards, making automation brittle. We’ve forked browser-use to solve some of these challenges. We’re working on analogous infrastructure to let agents operate on desktops and across a wide range of APIs.<p>- Verification: in healthcare, tasks need to be provably correct. We embed deterministic checks into each workflow so agents can confirm the task was completed as expected and the output is accurate.<p>- Workflow generation: clinic SOPs are written in natural language and vary widely, yet still describe the actual process that works for clinics.<p>We charge per task, based on complexity. We’re HIPAA compliant, audit-logged, and operate in a zero-retention environment unless auditing requires otherwise.<p>A meaningful part is building trust in a high-stakes environment like healthcare. Part of that is making the product reliable. But another educational part is learning how to introduce a new concept like “agents” to clinics. We’re working on the right ways to describe them, to onboard them, to measure them. Endearingly, one of our customers’ agents is named “Robert Ott”, and they refer to him by name in their weekly updates like he’s a member of the team :) We’re learning a lot and have a long way to go.<p>We’d love to meet other folks who 1. work in medical groups or health systems and want to offload repetitive work, and 2. are building in this space and want to trade notes. We’re happy to share everything we’ve learned so far.<p>And this is a big space, with a lot of learnings from personal stories, from clinicians, technologists, administrators, and more. What do you make of it? We’d love to hear from you.",

This way your coding agent actually teaches the course content to you and can help you write the code. We think this is a really interactive way to learn.<p>Using an editor with MCP support (such as Cursor, Windsurf, or VSCode), your code agent will call the appropriate MCP tools which will return context for the agent.

We&#x27;re building Chonkie (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chonkie.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chonkie.ai</a>), an open-source library for chunking and embedding data.<p>Python: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie</a><p>TypeScript: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie-ts\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie-ts</a><p>Here&#x27;s a video showing our code chunker: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Xclkh6bU1P0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Xclkh6bU1P0</a>.<p>Bhavnick and I have been building personal projects with LLMs for a few years. For much of this time, we found ourselves writing our own chunking logic to support RAG applications. We often hesitated to use existing libraries because they either had only basic features or felt too bloated (some are 80MB+).<p>We built Chonkie to be lightweight, fast, extensible, and easy. The space is evolving rapidly, and we wanted Chonkie to be able to quickly support the newest strategies. We currently support: Token Chunking, Sentence Chunking, Recursive Chunking, Semantic Chunking, plus:<p>-  Semantic Double Pass Chunking: Chunks text semantically first, then merges closely related chunks.<p>-  Code Chunking: Chunks code files by creating an AST and finding ideal split points.<p>-  Late Chunking: Based on the paper (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2409.04701\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2409.04701</a>), where chunk embeddings are derived from embedding a longer document.<p>-  Slumber Chunking: Based on the &quot;Lumber Chunking&quot; paper (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2406.17526\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2406.17526</a>). It uses recursive chunking, then an LLM verifies split points, aiming for high-quality chunks with reduced token usage and LLM costs.<p>You can see how Chonkie compares to LangChain and LlamaIndex in our benchmarks: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;BENCHMARKS.md\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;BENCHMARKS....</a><p>Some technical details about the Chonkie package:  - ~15MB default install vs. ~80-170MB for some alternatives. - Up to 33x faster token chunking compared to LangChain and LlamaIndex in our tests. - Works with major tokenizers (transformers, tokenizers, tiktoken). - Zero external dependencies for basic functionality. - Implements aggressive caching and precomputation. - Uses running mean pooling for efficient semantic chunking. - Modular dependency system (install only what you need).<p>In addition to chunking, Chonkie also provides an easy way to create embeddings. For supported providers (SentenceTransformer, Model2Vec, OpenAI), you just specify the model name as a string. You can also create custom embedding handlers for other providers.<p>RAG is still the most common use case currently. However, Chonkie makes chunks that are optimized for creating high quality embeddings and vector retrieval, so it is not really tied to the &quot;generation&quot; part of RAG. In fact, We&#x27;re seeing more and more people use Chonkie for implementing semantic search and&#x2F;or setting context for agents.<p>We are currently focused on building integrations to simplify the retrieval process. We&#x27;ve created &quot;handshakes&quot; – thin functions that interact with vector DBs like pgVector, Chroma, TurboPuffer, and Qdrant, allowing you to interact with storage easily. If there&#x27;s an integration you&#x27;d like to see (vector DB or otherwise), please let us know.<p>We also offer hosted and on-premise versions with OCR, extra metadata, all embedding providers, and managed vector databases for teams that want a fully managed pipeline. If you&#x27;re interested, reach out at shreyash@chonkie.ai or book a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cal.com&#x2F;shreyashn&#x2F;chonkie-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cal.com&#x2F;shreyashn&#x2F;chonkie-demo</a>.<p>We&#x27;re eager to hear your feedback and comments!

Unless you make it dead-simple, or better yet - a little fun.<p>After shipping a few SaaS products, I noticed a pattern: Bugs? Yes. Bug reports? No.<p>Not because users didn’t care but because reporting bugs is usually a terrible experience.<p>Most tools want users to:<p>* Fill out a long form<p>* Enter their email<p>* Describe a bug they barely understand<p>* Maybe sign in or create an account<p>* Then maybe submit it<p>Let’s be real: no one’s doing that. Especially not someone just trying to use your product.<p>So I built Bugdrop.app - It’s a little draggable bug icon that users can drop right on the issue, type a quick note, and they’re done. No logins. No forms. Just context-rich feedback that your team can actually use — with screenshots, browser info, even console logs if they hit an error.<p>And weirdly? People actually use it. Even non-technical users click it just because &quot;the little bug looked fun.&quot;<p>I didn’t want to build another &quot;feedback suite&quot;. I just wanted something lightweight, fast, and so stupidly simple that people actually report stuff. If you&#x27;ve ever had a user say “something’s broken” and then ghost you forever, you probably get where I’m coming from.<p>What I’m most proud of? People are actually using it. And their users? They’re actually reporting stuff. Even non-technical ones.<p>Would love to hear if you’ve faced similar problems, and if this feels like something that would’ve helped in your own projects. Not trying to sell you anything — just sharing something I built to scratch my own itch.",
