In reporting articles about science, and being a biology-watcher generally, I’ve had an uneasy time squaring my enthusiasm for cutting-edge biomedical research with the fact that this research so regularly involves breeding animals just to give them diseases and kill them. This is done as humanely as possible, of course.<p>The contrast hit me most vividly during the pandemic when I was writing an article about the immune system. [1] One of the scientists I spoke to told me about putting hamsters on warming plates, picking them up gently — in general, caring for and about them — and then feeling grief at their deaths. But of course understanding the immune response during infection with covid was a worthy cause. I felt no judgement towards this scientist; they are in a difficult position.<p>There was another more direct bit of inspiration, when I read this article [2], in 2023, about the toll that caring for laboratory animals could take on people’s mental health:<p>&gt; <i>Besides the symptoms Sessions experienced, those who handle lab animals may face insomnia, chronic physical ailments, zombielike lack of empathy, and, in extreme cases, severe depression, substance abuse, and thoughts of suicide. As many as nine in 10 people in the profession will suffer from compassion fatigue at some point during their careers, according to recent research, more than twice the rate of those who work in hospital intensive care units. It’s one of the leading reasons animal care workers quit.</i><p>That left an impression on me, and also armed me with a character: the forgotten-about, somewhat miserable vivarium worker.<p>The story obviously takes many liberties with fact — it is fiction — but I also tried to ground it in reality, and stuff that you might think I made up (the guillotine, the crazy VR sphere in the first paragraph), I did not.<p>I hope you enjoy! If nothing else I expect you’ll appreciate the illustrations, done by my friend Ben Smith [3].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;how-the-coronavirus-hacks-the-immune-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;how-the-corona...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;suffering-silence-caring-research-animals-can-take-severe-mental-toll\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;suffering-silence-ca...</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenbonesproductions.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenbonesproductions.com&#x2F;</a>",

Instead, I wanted to hear the actual debate from the actual thread!<p>So I asked Claude 3.7 to build this for me as a browser-only app. It just needs a thread URL and an Elevenlabs API key (this all remains in your browser, you can check the source code, it&#x27;s only 3 files, there is no server storage of anything).<p>To make the resulting audio experience as natural as possible, each commenter has a different voice.<p>Commenters who appear multiple times in the thread have the same voice, and introduce themselves. A bit of context is also introduced when coming back &quot;up&quot; from deeply nested comments.<p>You can play the resulting audio or download it for later listening. I&#x27;m planning to later add the ability to load multiple threads so I can have a playlist generated for listening in the gym!<p>Any comments or improvement suggestions are appreciated!",

It understands what you&#x27;re reading and working on, whether that&#x27;s email, research, or anything else in your tabs.<p>We started out building a full email client with AI built in (you might have seen that version showcased in YC’s AI Design Review - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DBhSfROq3wU&amp;t=1601s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DBhSfROq3wU&amp;t=1601s</a>), but learned that people don&#x27;t actually want to leave their existing tools - they just want them to work better. Gmail might be frustrating, but it has years of features people rely on. So we pivoted to enhance the tools people already use, rather than replace them entirely.<p>Some specific things Zuni does today:<p>- Analyzes emails as you read them in Gmail, identifying action items and suggesting possible responses\n- Lets you discuss how to handle tricky emails, almost like having a thought partner\n- Maintains context across your browsing session so you can ask follow-up questions naturally\n- Runs locally first for speed and privacy\n- Doesn&#x27;t store chats, emails or anything sensitive in the cloud<p>We&#x27;re still early and focusing on getting the core experience right before adding more integrations. The goal is to make AI actually useful in your daily work, rather than just another &quot;AI feature&quot; checkbox.<p>Would genuinely love feedback from the HN community - what would make this truly useful for your workflow? What are we missing?<p>Happy to answer any questions about the technical implementation too.",

It combines models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google to achieve better results, more reliable agent behavior, better cost efficiency, and better performance than is possible by using only a single provider’s models.<p>I believe it is now one of the best tools available for working on large tasks in real world codebases with AI. It has an effective context window of 2M tokens, and can index projects of 20M tokens and beyond using tree-sitter project maps (30+ languages are supported). It can effectively find relevant context in massive million-line projects like SQLite, Redis, and Git.<p>A bit more on some of Plandex’s key features:<p>- Plandex has a built-in diff review sandbox that helps you get the benefits of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project. By default, all changes accumulate in the sandbox until you approve them. The sandbox is version-controlled. You can rewind it to any previous point, and you can also create branches to try out alternative approaches.<p>- It offers a ‘full auto mode’ that can complete large tasks autonomously end-to-end, including high level planning, context loading, detailed planning, implementation, command execution (for dependencies, builds, tests, etc.), and debugging.<p>- The autonomy level is highly configurable. You can move up and down the ladder of autonomy depending on the task, your comfort level, and how you weigh cost optimization vs. effort and results.<p>- Models and model settings are also very configurable. There are built-in models and model packs for different use cases. You can also add custom models and model packs, and customize model settings like temperature or top-p. All model changes are version controlled, so you can use branches to try out the same task with different models. The newly released OpenAI models and the paid Gemini 2.5 Pro model will be integrated in the default model pack soon.<p>- It can be easily self-hosted, including a ‘local mode’ for a very fast local single-user setup with Docker.<p>- Cloud hosting is also available for added convenience with a couple of subscription tiers: an ‘Integrated Models’ mode that requires no other accounts or API keys and allows you to manage billing&#x2F;budgeting&#x2F;spending alerts and track usage centrally, and a ‘BYO API Key’ mode that allows you to use your own OpenAI&#x2F;OpenRouter accounts.<p>I’d love to get more HNers in the Plandex Discord (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;plandex-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;plandex-ai</a>). Please join and say hi!<p>And of course I’d love to hear your feedback, whether positive or negative. Thanks so much!",

      "text": "Hey HN, we’re building mrge (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home</a>), an AI code review platform to help teams merge code faster with fewer bugs. Our early users include Better Auth, Cal.com, and n8n—teams that handle a lot of PRs every day.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY</a><p>We (Allis and Paul) are engineers who faced this problem when we worked together at our last startup. Code review quickly became our biggest bottleneck—especially as we started using AI to code more. We had more PRs to review, subtle AI-written bugs slipped through unnoticed, and we (humans) increasingly found ourselves rubber-stamping PRs without deeply understanding the changes.<p>We’re building mrge to help solve that. Here’s how it works:<p>1. Connect your GitHub repo via our Github app in two clicks (and optionally download our desktop app). Gitlab support is on the roadmap!<p>2. AI Review: When you open a PR, our AI reviews your changes directly in an ephemeral and secure container. It has context into not just that PR, but your whole codebase, so it can pick up patterns and leave comments directly on changed lines. Once the review is done, the sandbox is torn down and your code deleted – we don’t store it for obvious reasons.<p>3. Human-friendly review workflow: Jump into our web app (it’s like Linear but for PRs). Changes are grouped logically (not alphabetically), with important diffs highlighted, visualized, and ready for faster human review.<p>The AI reviewer works a bit like Cursor in the sense that it navigates your codebase using the same tools a developer would—like jumping to definitions or grepping through code.<p>But a big challenge was that, unlike Cursor, mrge doesn’t run in your local IDE or editor. We had to recreate something similar entirely in the cloud.<p>Whenever you open a PR, mrge clones your repository and checks out your branch in a secure and isolated temporary sandbox.  We provision this sandbox with shell access and a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server. The AI reviewer then reviews your code, navigating the codebase exactly as a human reviewer would—using shell commands and common editor features like &quot;go to definition&quot; or &quot;find references&quot;. When the review finishes, we immediately tear down the sandbox and delete the code—we don’t want to permanently store it for obvious reasons.<p>We know cloud-based review isn&#x27;t for everyone, especially if security or compliance requires local deployments. But a cloud approach lets us run SOTA AI models without local GPU setups, and provide a consistent, single AI review per PR for an entire team.<p>The platform itself focuses entirely on making <i>human</i> code reviews easier. A big inspiration came from productivity-focused apps like Linear or Superhuman, products that show just how much thoughtful design can impact everyday workflows. We wanted to bring that same feeling into code review.<p>That’s one reason we built a desktop app. It allowed us to deliver a more polished experience, complete with keyboard shortcuts and a snappy interface.<p>Beyond performance, the main thing we care about is making it easier for humans to read and understand code. For example, traditional review tools sort changed files alphabetically—which forces reviewers to figure out the order in which they should review changes. In mrge, files are automatically grouped and ordered based on logical connections, letting reviewers immediately jump in.<p>We think the future of coding isn’t about AI replacing humans—it’s about giving us better tools to quickly understand high-level changes, abstracting more and more of the code itself. As code volume continues to increase, this shift is going to become increasingly important.<p>You can sign up now (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home</a>). mrge is currently free while we&#x27;re still early. Our plan for later is to charge closed-source projects on a per-seat basis, and to continue giving mrge away for free to open source ones.<p>We’re very actively building and would love your honest feedback!",
