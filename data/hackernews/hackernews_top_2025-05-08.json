Pages display in fullscreen without margins, with proper fixed layout support. Its main feature is various optional image processing steps to look good on eink screens, which have different requirements than normal LCD screens. It also does filesize optimization by downscaling to your specific device&#x27;s screen resolution, which can improve performance on underpowered ereaders. Supported input formats include folders&#x2F;CBZ&#x2F;CBR&#x2F;PDF of JPG&#x2F;PNG files and more. Supported output formats include MOBI&#x2F;AZW3, EPUB, KEPUB, and CBZ.<p>Hey everyone! I&#x27;m the current maintainer of KCC since 2023, thanks for using it! I’ve been reading manga on Kindle ever since I got the big 9.7” Kindle DX from 2010 using mangle, and upgraded to the even bigger 10.2” Kindle Scribe 2022 using KCC.<p>The biggest contributions I&#x27;ve made to KCC are:<p>- added modern macOS support and removed homebrew requirement\n- ported code to run on native Apple silicon M1 chip and later for a 2x speed boost (qt5-&gt;qt6)\n- free open source windows codesign with SignPath - fixed Kindle Scribe support\n- and tons of other various features and bug fixes and developer friendly changes\n- created a legacy Windows 7 build with 300+ downloads…<p>The biggest community PRs were:<p>- huge 2x speed boosts due to various CPU&#x2F;IO optimizations\n- Kobo&#x2F;Remarkable support<p>Enjoy using KCC and let me know if you have any questions!",

We’re building Plexe (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe</a>), an open-source agent that turns natural language task descriptions into trained ML models. Here’s a video walkthrough: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bUwCSglhcXY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bUwCSglhcXY</a>.<p>There are all kinds of uses for ML models that never get realized because the process of making them is messy and convoluted. You can spend months trying to find the data, clean it, experiment with models and deploy to production, only to find out that your project has been binned for taking so long. There are many tools for “automating” ML, but it still takes teams of ML experts to actually productionize something of value. And we can’t keep throwing LLMs at every ML problem. Why use a generic 10B parameter language model, if a logistic regression trained on your data could do the job better?<p>Our light-bulb moment was that we could use LLMs to generate task-specific ML models that would be trained on one’s own data. Thanks to the emergent reasoning ability of LLMs, it is now possible to create an agentic system that might automate most of the ML lifecycle.<p>A couple of months ago, we started developing a Python library that would let you define ML models on structured data using a description of the expected behaviour. Our initial implementation arranged potential solutions into a graph, using LLMs to write plans, implement them as code, and run the resulting training script. Using simple search algorithms, the system traversed the solution space to identify and package the best model.<p>However, we ran into several limitations, as the algorithm proved brittle under edge cases, and we kept having to put patches for every minor issue in the training process. We decided to rethink the approach, throw everything out, and rebuild the tool using an agentic approach prioritising generality and flexibility. What started as a single ML engineering agent turned into an agentic ML &quot;team&quot;, with all experiments tracked and logged using MLFlow.<p>Our current implementation uses the smolagents library to define an agent hierarchy. We mapped the functionality of our previous implementation to a set of specialized agents, such as an “ML scientist” that proposes solution plans, and so on. Each agent has specialized tools, instructions, and prompt templates. To facilitate cross-agent communication, we implemented a shared memory that enables objects (datasets, code snippets, etc) to be passed across agents indirectly by referencing keys in a registry. You can find a detailed write-up on how it works here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;multi-agent-system.md\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architectur...</a><p>Plexe’s early release is focused on predictive problems over structured data, and can be used to build models such as forecasting player injury risk in high-intensity sports, product recommendations for an e-commerce marketplace, or predicting technical indicators for algorithmic trading. Here are some examples to get you started: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples</a><p>To get it working on your data, you can dump any CSV, parquet, etc and Plexe uses what it needs from your dataset to figure out what features it should use. In the open-source tool, it only supports adding files right now but in our platform version, we&#x27;ll have support for integrating with Postgres where it pulls all available data based on an SQL query and dumps it into a parquet file for the agent to build models.<p>Next up, we’ll be tackling more of the ML project lifecycle: we’re currently working on adding a “feature engineering agent” that focuses on the complex data transformations that are often required for data to be ready for model training. If you&#x27;re interested, check Plexe out and let us know your thoughts!",

      "text": "Hey HN! We’re Will and Jeff from Exa (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.ai</a>). We recently launched Exa Websets, an embeddings-powered search engine designed to return exactly what you’re asking for. You can get precise results for complex queries like “all startups working on open-source developer tools based in SF, founded 2021-2025”. \nDemo here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Unt8hJmCxd4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Unt8hJmCxd4</a><p>We started working on Exa because we were frustrated that while LLM state-of-the-art is advancing every week, Google has gotten worse over time. The Internet used to feel like a magical information portal, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore when you’re constantly being pushed towards SEO-optimized clickbait.<p>Websets is a step in the opposite direction. For every search, we perform dozens of embedding searches over Exa’s vector database of the web to find good search candidates, then we run agentic workflows on each result to verify they match exactly what you asked for.<p>Websets results are good for two reasons. First, we train custom embedding models for our main search algorithm, instead of typical keyword matching search algorithms. Our embeddings models are trained specifically to return exactly the type of entity you ask for. In practice, that means if you search “startups working in nanotech”, keyword-based search engines return listicles about nanotech startups, because these listicles match the keywords in the query. In contrast, our embedding models return actual startup homepages, because these startup homepages match the meaning of the query.<p>The second is that LLMs provide the last-mile intelligence needed to verify every result. Each result and piece of data is backed with supporting references that we used to validate that the result is actually a match for your search criteria. That’s why Websets can take minutes or even hours to run, depending on your query and how many results you ask for. For valuable search queries, we think this is worth it.<p>Also notably, Websets are tables, not lists. You can add “enrichment” columns to find more information about each result, like “# of employees” or “does author have blog?”, and the cells asynchronously load in. This table format hopefully makes the web feel more like a database.<p>A few examples of searches that work with Websets:<p>- “Math blogs created by teachers from outside the US”: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn</a><p>- &quot;research paper about ways to avoid the O(n^2) attention problem in transformers, where one of the first author&#x27;s first name starts with &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, or &quot;T&quot;, and it was written between 2018 and 2022”: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h</a><p>- “US based healthcare companies, with over 100 employees and a technical founder&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2</a><p>- “all software engineers in the Bay Area, with experience in startups, who know Rust and have published technical content before”: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;knjrlm1aibQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;knjrlm1aibQ</a><p>You can try it at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;</a> and API docs are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.exa.ai&#x2F;websets\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.exa.ai&#x2F;websets</a>.

      "text": "Hi everyone, my name is Kevin Lin, and this is a Show HN for my sheet music smart glasses project. My video was on the front page on Friday: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43876243\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43876243</a>, but dang said we should do a Show HN as well, so here goes!<p>I’ve wanted to put sheet music into smart glasses for a long time, but the perfect opportunity to execute came in mid-February, when Mentra (YC W25) tweeted about a smart glasses hackathon they were hosting - winners would get to take home a pair. I went, had a blast making a bunch of music-related apps with my teammate, and we won, so I got to take them home, refine the project, and make a pretty cool video about it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE</a>).<p>The glasses are Even Realities G1s. They look normal, but they have two microphones, a screen in each lens, and can be even made with a prescription. Every person I’ve met who tried them on was surprised at how good the display is, and the video recordings of them unfortunately don’t do them justice.<p>The software runs on AugmentOS, which is Mentra’s smart glasses operating system that works on various 3rd-party smart glasses, including the G1s. All I had to do to make an app was write and run a typescript file using the AugmentOS SDK. This gives you the voice transcription and raw audio as input, and text or bitmaps available as output to the screens, everything else is completely abstracted away. Your glasses communicate with an AugmentOS app, and then the app communicates with your typescript service.<p>The only hard part was creating a Python script to turn sheet music (MusicXML format) into small, optimized bitmaps to display on the screens. To start, the existing landscape of music-related Python libraries is pretty poorly documented and I ran into multiple never-before-seen error messages. Downscaling to the small size of the glasses screens also meant that stems and staff lines were disappearing, so I thought to use morphological dilation to emphasize those without making the notes unintelligible.  The final pipeline was MusicXML -&gt; music21 library to render chunks of bars to png -&gt; dilate with opencv- &gt; downscale -&gt; convert to bitmap with Pillow -&gt; optimize bitmaps with imagemagick. This is far from the best code I’ve ever written, but the LLMs attempt at this whole task was abysmal and my years of Python experience really got to shine here. The code is on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinlinxc&#x2F;AugmentedChords\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinlinxc&#x2F;AugmentedChords</a>.<p>Putting it together, my typescript service serves these bitmaps locally when requested. I put together a UI where I can navigate menus and sheet music with voice commands (e.g. show catalog, next, select, start, exit, pause) and then I connected foot pedals to my laptop. Because of bitmap sending latency (~3s right now, but future glasses will do better), using foot pedals to turn the bars while playing wasn’t viable, so I instead had one of my pedals toggle autoscrolling, and the other two pedals sped up&#x2F;temporarily paused the scrolling.<p>After lots of adjustments, I was able to play a full song using just the glasses! It took many takes and there was definitely lots of room for improvement. For example: - Bitmap sending is pretty slow, which is why using the foot pedals to turn bars wasn’t viable. - The resolution is pretty small, I would love to put more bars in at once so I can flip less frequently. - Since foot pedals aren’t portable, it would be cool to have a mode where the audio dictates when the sheet music changes. I tried implementing that with FFT but it was often wrong and more effort is needed. Head tilt controls would be cool too, because full manual control is a hard requirement for practicing.<p>All of these pain points are being targeted by Mentra and other companies competing in the space, and so I’m super excited to see the next generation! Also, feel free to ask me anything!",

      "text": "Hi HN! While working on a project that involves frequently parsing a lot of feeds, I needed a fast JavaScript-based parser to extract specific fields from feed namespaces. Existing Node packages were either too slow or merged all feed formats, losing namespace information. So I decided to write it myself and created this NPM package with a simple API.<p>Feedsmith supports all feed formats and many popular namespaces, including: Podcast, Media, iTunes, Dublin Core, and more. It can also parse and generate OPML files.<p>I am currently adding support for more namespaces and feed generation for RSS, Atom and RDF. The library grew into something bigger than I initially anticipated, so I also started creating a dedicated documentation website to describe all the features.",
