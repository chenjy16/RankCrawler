It&#x27;s currently in alpha and isn&#x27;t remotely bug free. I had been holding off on posting this here until it was somewhat presentable and useful. Please note; the Lisa conforms more literally to the desktop metaphor than most modern GUIs - some of the important differences are mentioned in the readme.<p>This is a complete recreation of the UI in JS; it all renders to a single canvas element. It&#x27;s not a CSS theme, and not an emulator ported to JS. None of the code is written by Apple. I&#x27;ll be happy to elaborate more in the comments, but the short version is the entire UI is defined outside the DOM using JS objects. Thus, every interface element - menus, windows, controls, and even typefaces - was recreated from scratch. There are no font files - I wrote my own typesetting system, which supports combining multiple text styles and generates new glyph variants on the fly.<p>Many of the technical decisions I made were motivated by a desire to have this look the same in every browser. That&#x27;s harder to do with the DOM and CSS, and why I moved as much logic as I could to JS. Also, the only part of the project outside of vanilla JS and standard web APIs is the Gulp toolkit, which I&#x27;m using as a minification&#x2F;build tool. No vibe coding was used to make this!<p>This is based on a UI from the 80s, and won&#x27;t work well on your phone. If you insist on running it that way, turn on trackpad mode in the touchscreen settings panel of the preferences app. For best results, install it as a PWA (add it to your home screen). Also there are some odd Android bugs; the native touchscreen keyboard is currently broken, and there&#x27;s an issue with the cursor when dragging windows.<p>I realize there&#x27;s not a whole lot to do within LisaGUI right now; I&#x27;ve got a big list of additional features and apps I&#x27;ll be adding in the future.  I&#x27;ve been working on this project for a while, and I&#x27;m eager to hear people&#x27;s feedback and answer questions about it.",

If you need fine-grained control (e.g. streaming, memory control), use the native API directly:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ai&#x2F;prompt-api\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ai&#x2F;prompt-api</a><p>Would love to hear what people build with it or any feedback!",

We faced issues like limited control over agent memory and state, complicated persistence, scaling problems, and lack of type safety in Python-based tools. These challenges inspired us to try something different.\nThe result was GraphFlow, a Rust-based lean framework for orchestrating multi-agent workflows that&#x27;s simple, scalable, and robust. Its key features include:\nGraph-based orchestration: Easily define workflows using nodes and edges.\nLean Execution Engine: A minimal and efficient graph executor &#x2F; state machine implementation.\nClear Memory Management: Direct and transparent handling of agent states.\nSimple DB Schema: Easy-to-understand schema for persistence and state tracking.\nHigh Performance: Native Rust performance with low overhead and easy scaling.\nType Safety: Rust&#x27;s type system reduces runtime errors.\nGraphFlow is open-source ofc and aims to solve real-world problems we&#x27;ve experienced firsthand.\nWe&#x27;d love your feedback!",

It finally hit me that I’d rather invest that time in code than in Ctrl-C&#x2F;Ctrl-V, so I built ParsePoint.app.<p>Why I built it\n • Manual invoice entry was swallowing 4 hours every month.\n • Accounting software APIs felt heavyweight for my use-case; I really just wanted clean rows in a spreadsheet.\n • I love tinkering with AI models and needed an excuse to spin one up in production.<p>What it does\n 1. Upload a PDF (or forward an email).\n 2. ParsePoint’s AI OCR extracts line-items, amounts, tax, dates, etc.\n 3. Download a ready-to-pivot Excel&#x2F;CSV file or hit the API to drop the data wherever you like.<p>Under the hood\n • Frontend: React\n • API: .NET 8, PostgreSQL\n • AI layer: an open-source VLLM model fine-tuned for document layouts<p>Outcome so far\n • My own workload: from 4 hours&#x2F;month to less than 10 minutes.\n • Early beta testers (other solo-store owners) report similar time savings and fewer bookkeeping errors.\n • The pay-as-you-go credit system means no subscriptions or lock-ins—use it only when you need it.<p>I’d love feedback on the tech approach, pricing model, or anything that looks off. All comments welcome, and I’m here to answer every question.<p>Thanks for reading!\nMarcin – maker of ParsePoint.app",

      "text": "TLDR: I made a community where you can find builders or product owners to collab on sideprojects together with &lt;3<p>A year ago i completed my first sideproject, a digital course on how to &quot;cold email a chief information security officer&quot;. I thought and think its a great course, but of course I fell into all the traps (didnt verify a need, i thought id make it and everyone would buy automatically), i tested google ads but hated nerding on that, so i decided to find a marketing person to partner up with! But i knew no one! That got me thinking how many people with relevant knowledge that isnt connected to others who need it, so i started gathering these people in an excel doc with what they know and then we created a slack channel for this etc! (fenomener.framer.website). Suddenly now we are 400 people sharing about our projects and collaborating! But if there is one thing ive been missing its &quot;profile pages&quot;, that doesnt work well in slack. Id love to see an awesome project but then lurk a bit on who this person is before engaging in anything. so thats when we made the common decision of: what the heck, lets just build the thing we want.<p>So I partnered up with a fullstack (from the community!!!!!) and built relentlessly.no. we have like 50 users now and 17 projects and just finished our Minimum Lovable Product. Its not good enough yet and we are working on adding notifications and at least optimizing for first the product leader flow, then the builder flow. (we often get product leaders with a demo joining that are HUNGRY for devs, or we get builders hungry for anyone with an idea! its a god damn marketplace maybe!)<p>I actually think this might become 1000x more important than YC, because its place and time independant, and no one or no org has taken a place in the important space of sideprojects, where actually &quot;everything begins&quot;. SIdeprojects sound so naive and not important, but after nerding on this a year i kinda see them as the most powerful thing we have. And this feels exactly as counter intuitive as a great idea should feel. So if we can let relentlessly resourceful people around the globe bump into each other, then the next gen of startups will be born here. Thats freaking meaningful stuff. And the hidden gem in all of this is something that didnt strike me before i had been working on it for a year: The point isnt to find someone to collab on your current sideproject. The whole value is the relationships that get formed. Because now after a year in this space then sideprojects have come and gone, but i have like 8 new &quot;cofounder ready&quot; relationships formed, where i actually trust them and &quot;know&quot; them and can build in the future with them. So i guess we are sortof solving &quot;cofounder matching&quot; without the akward &quot;cofounder meetup night&quot;, or the slow &quot;you HAVE to go to school with them for four years.<p>business wise this is my passion project for life I feel, and the ethical founder friendly direction im pursuing is just adding this on the site: &quot;if you met your cofounder here, like the product and youre raising money with another confirmed investor: please invite me to your round &lt;3&quot;<p>I dont have money but maybe that will sort itself out, so this just makes me the worlds poorest investor with the most original investment product ever :D",

It was before the Unitree G1 came out so the cheapest option at the time costed over $50k, but I figured I could build one for about $10k using COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) components, which would be a much better price point for indie hackers and developers.<p>We built the first version using some 3D printers and parts that I bought off of Amazon and Alibaba. It was not great, but it let us build out the full pipeline, from designing and building the hardware to training control policies in simulation. We actually did most of this in about two months, and had a standing, waving robot by YC Demo Day (although it wasn&#x27;t good for much else!).<p>Since then, our focus has been on figuring out how to go from a hobby-grade robot to a consumer-grade robot, without inflating our BOM (Bill of Materials, i.e. cost of all the parts) or having to set up our own factories. This is surprisingly difficult. A lot of the supply chain for robotics components currently goes through China, but tariffs have made it difficult to rely on Chinese suppliers for components. Also, even a $10k price point is pretty expensive for most customers, for a humanoid robot that has fairly limited capabilities.<p>Our solution to this is to open-source our hardware and software. This makes it easier for us to navigate tariffs and manufacturing challenges. By making our reference design public, our suppliers have a much easier time figuring out how to offer us competitive solutions, and our manufacturing partners are able to more easily adjust our design for their production processes.<p>On the demand side, the basic problem with humanoid robots is that they&#x27;re mostly useless right now, and it will probably be a long and fairly capital-intensive journey to make them useful. My expectation was that there is a large pool of latent interest from people like me who are interested in hacking on humanoids, and that this customer segment is a much better customer segment to sell into than more traditional business-focused robotics applications. As someone in this customer segment myself, I felt that open-source software and hardware would be a strong value proposition, particularly for developers exploring bringing humanoids into their own business verticals.<p>More philosophically, I think it is important that there is a good, open-source humanoid robot. I think the technology is likely to mature much more rapidly than many people currently expect, and the idea of armies of humanoids owned by some single company walking around is pretty dystopian.<p>Right now, we&#x27;re selling our base humanoid robot, K-Bot, for $8999. The main reason we&#x27;re selling it now, instead of waiting to do more R&amp;D, is because we&#x27;re trying to negotiate volume prices with our own suppliers before we do final DfM (Design for Manufacturing). For example, we are able to negotiate better volume pricing for actuators and end effectors than what the average indie developer would be able to get for low-volume orders.<p>However, a lot of the people who want to buy a humanoid robot today do so because they want a completely autonomous robot to do all their chores, which is a pretty hard (although exciting) thing to build. To square this circle, we&#x27;re offering a &quot;Full Autonomy&quot; option - it is the same robot hardware, but we will provide free hardware and software upgrades until we are able to make the robot fully autonomous. This way, we can have some extra cash upfront to kickstart development, and start to build a core group of people who are aligned with helping us improve the robot&#x27;s capabilities across a diverse set of environments. From our customers&#x27; perspective, it&#x27;s a way to de-risk buying a first-generation product from a young hardware company, and to have a bigger influence on how the technology unfolds.<p>The best part about building open source software and hardware is getting torn apart by people smarter than us, so we&#x27;d love your feedback!",
