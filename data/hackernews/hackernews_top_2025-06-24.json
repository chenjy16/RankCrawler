Reducto turns unstructured documents (e.g., PDFs, scans, spreadsheets) into structured data. This data can then be used for retrieval, passed into LLMs, or used elsewhere downstream.<p>We started Reducto when we realized that so many of today’s AI applications require good quality data. Everyone knows that good inputs lead to better outputs, but 80% of the world’s data is still trapped inside of things like messy PDFs and spreadsheets. Raunak and I launched a really early MVP of parsing and extracting from unstructured documents, and were lucky to have a lot of interest from technical teams when they realized that the accuracy was something they hadn’t seen before.<p>We started by just releasing an API for engineers to build with, but over time we realized that an accurate API was only part of the puzzle. Our customers wanted to be able to easily set up multi step pipelines, evaluate and iterate on performance within their use case, and work with non-engineering teammates that were also involved in the real world document processing flow.<p>That’s why we’re launching Reducto Studio, a web platform that sits on top of our APIs for users to build and iterate on end-to-end document pipelines.<p>With Studio, you can:<p>- Drop an entire file set and get per-field and per-document accuracy scores against your eval data.<p>- Auto-generate and continuously optimize extraction schemas to hit production-grade quality fast.<p>- Save every run, iterate on parse&#x2F;extract configs, and compare results side-by-side.<p>You can see some examples here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.reducto.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.reducto.ai</a>) or you can watch this walkthrough: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b243551741c642c6a594c00353fcecb3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b243551741c642c6a594c00353fcecb3</a>.<p>If you’d like to upload your own document you can log in and do so as well - we don’t make you book a demo or put a payment down to try it.<p>Thanks for reading and checking it out! This is only the first step for Studio, so we’d love feedback on anything: UX rough edges (we know they’re there!), features that would make evaluations better for you, hard documents you’ve had trouble with, or anything else about wrangling with unstructured data.",

      "text": "Hey HN, Gabe and Alexander here from Hatchet. Today we&#x27;re releasing Pickaxe, a Typescript library to build AI agents which are scalable and fault-tolerant.<p>Here&#x27;s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;b28fc406-f501-4427-9574-e4c756b29dd4\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;b28fc406-f501-442...</a><p>Pickaxe provides a simple set of primitives for building agents which can automatically checkpoint their state and suspend or resume processing (also known as durable execution) while waiting for external events (like a human in the loop). The library is based on common patterns we&#x27;ve seen when helping Hatchet users run millions of agent executions per day.<p>Unlike other tools, Pickaxe is not a framework. It does not have any opinions or abstractions for implementing agent memory, prompting, context, or calling LLMs directly. Its only focus is making AI agents more observable and reliable.<p>As agents start to scale, there are generally three big problems that emerge:\n1. Agents are long-running compared to other parts of your application. Extremely long-running processes are tricky because deploying new infra or hitting request timeouts on serverless runtimes will interrupt their execution. \n2. They are stateful: they generally store internal state which governs the next step in the execution path\n3. They require access to lots of fresh data, which can either be queried during agent execution or needs to be continuously refreshed from a data source.<p>(These problems are more specific to agents which execute remotely -- locally running agents generally don&#x27;t have these problems)<p>Pickaxe is designed to solve these issues by providing a simple API which wraps durable execution infrastructure for agents. Durable execution is a way of automatically checkpointing the state of a process, so that if the process fails, it can automatically be replayed from the checkpoint, rather than starting over from the beginning. This model is also particularly useful when your agent needs to wait for an external event or human review in order to continue execution. To support this pattern, Pickaxe uses a Hatchet feature called `waitFor` which durably registers a listener for an event, which means that even if the agent isn&#x27;t actively listening for the event, it is guaranteed to be processed by Hatchet and stored in the execution history and resume processing. This infrastructure is powered by what is essentially a linear event log, which stores the entire execution history of an agent in a Postgres database managed by Hatchet.<p>Full docs are here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pickaxe.hatchet.run&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pickaxe.hatchet.run&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;d greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get the chance to try out Pickaxe.",

I view it as a kind of night train Tetris (my wife less charitably calls it &quot;sardinology&quot;). I spent way too much  time learning about and sketching various layouts, trying to figure out how to fit the maximum number of private cabins into a standard railcar, while making them attractive for both day and night travel.<p>This eventually led to a physical workshop (in Berlin) and a hands-on rapid prototyping process. We&#x27;ve built a series of full-scale mockups, starting with wood and cardboard and progressing to high-fidelity versions with 3D-printed and CNC-milled parts, with various functional elements.<p>Hundreds of people have come in to test our various iterations, because you can&#x27;t test ergonomics or comfort by looking at renderings (although we did create a bunch of nice ones).<p>The link goes to our home page showing our approach and some of the thinking behind them. It’s been a lot of fun working on this puzzle, and we&#x27;re excited to share what we&#x27;ve come up with. We hope you think it&#x27;s cool too and would love to hear your thoughts.",

The forms are fiddly, there&#x27;s way too much information that needs to be copied down from the video by hand, you have to use a third-party app to take a timestamped video and a different app to compress it before uploading, and approximately none of it can be done on your phone — the device you probably used to record your video in the first place.<p>I built Idle Reporter to make filing complaints into a five-minute process that you can do entirely from your phone.<p>Idle Reporter uses AI to automatically extract all the required information and screenshots from the video and fill out the form for you. It compresses your video, adds the required screenshots, and uploads the whole thing to DEP. All you have to do is log in, give it a final check, and submit.<p>The AI features cost me money to run, so I put those behind a subscription ($5.99&#x2F;month, which can pay for itself after a single report). There&#x27;s a one-week free trial so you can test it out. All the other features — including a fully-featured timestamp camera, which other apps charge for, and an editor for filling out the forms manually and submitting in a single step — will be free forever, as a service to the community.<p>The app is iOS-only for now — part of this was an exercise in learning SwiftUI in my spare time.<p>Check it out on the App Store and let me know what you think!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;dep&#x2F;environment&#x2F;idling-citizens-air-complaint-program.page\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nyc.gov&#x2F;site&#x2F;dep&#x2F;environment&#x2F;idling-citizens-air...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-york-city-idling-law-reporters&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-york-city-idling-law-report...</a>",

I look for what other founders are building, check out new GitHub projects, and explore new products. But I started noticing that it was taking me the whole morning just to get through it all.<p>I began to wonder: could an AI help me read Hacker News more efficiently? Could it summarize everything so I can quickly scan through, and then dive deeper into what interests me? And more than that—could it store what I’ve seen so I can recall it later when it&#x27;s relevant?<p>That’s the idea behind EchoStream.<p>EchoStream is a local AI agent that runs entirely on your iPhone. It includes a built-in thinking model to help you do more with less effort—privately and efficiently, without sending your data anywhere.<p>Some of its key features:<p>- Read and understand web pages using AI<p>- OCR for recognizing and processing text in images<p>- Automatically record, transcribe, and summarize audio<p>- An AI-powered news feed with fresh, relevant updates<p>- Memory search that connects new info with what you’ve seen before<p>It’s still early, but I’d really appreciate your feedback or thoughts. I built this for myself, and now I want to share it with all of you.<p>You can have a try here:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;echostream-mind-copilot&#x2F;id6476086097\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;echostream-mind-copilot&#x2F;id6476...</a>\nor to the homesite: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.echostream-ai.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.echostream-ai.com&#x2F;</a><p>Note: It works well on any iDevice with at least 4GB of RAM.",
