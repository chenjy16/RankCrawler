      "text": "Hey everyone!<p>I&#x27;m excited to share a small web app I built that allows you to view and extract the contents of Windows MSI installers directly in your browser. It&#x27;s essentially a web-based &quot;lessmsi&quot; powered by Pyodide.<p>You can try it out at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pymsi.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;msi_viewer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pymsi.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;msi_viewer.html</a><p>My motivation for building this was from part of my day job -- I often get Windows MSI installers and need to extract files while preserving the relative directory structure and filenames, as they would appear after a full installation. The existing tools I found were good but limited in which platforms they support: lessmsi works great on Windows, while msitools works for Linux&#x2F;macOS. Neither is a truly cross-platform solution that works on any major OS.<p>So we developed pymsi (a pure Python library, available on GitHub at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi</a>) to handle reading and extracting MSI files from Python. Then I realized that since pymsi has no native dependencies, it could potentially run in a web browser using Pyodide. After a bit of &quot;vibe coding&quot; and fixing some &quot;hallucinated&quot; functions&#x2F;classes that don&#x27;t exist in pymsi, the result was this client-side web app.<p>If you need an MSI file to experiment with, older versions of PowerToys included the installer in .msi form, such as this one: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;PowerToys&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;v0.21.1&#x2F;PowerToysSetup-0.21.1-x64.msi\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;PowerToys&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;v0....</a><p>Note that the underlying pymsi library hasn&#x27;t been extensively tested against a bunch of MSI installers yet, so there might still be lingering bugs. If you come across any issues, please don&#x27;t hesitate to report them in on the GitHub repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi&#x2F;issues\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi&#x2F;issues</a>).<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!",

We&#x27;re building Nxtscape (&quot;next-scape&quot;) - an open-source, agentic browser for the AI era.<p>-- Why bother building a new browser?\nFor the first time since Netscape was released in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine browsers from scratch for the age of AI agents. The web browser of tomorrow might not look like what we have today.<p>We saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet the browser—where everyone else spends their entire workday—hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed.<p>And honestly, we feel like we&#x27;re constantly fighting the browser we use every day. It&#x27;s not one big thing, but a series of small, constant frustrations. I&#x27;ll have 70+ tabs open from three different projects and completely lose my train of thought. And simple stuff like reordering tide pods from amazon or filling out forms shouldn&#x27;t need our full attention anymore. AI can handle all of this, and that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re building.<p>Here’s a demo of our early version <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dub.sh&#x2F;nxtscape-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dub.sh&#x2F;nxtscape-demo</a><p>-- What makes us different\nWe know others are exploring this space (Perplexity, Dia), but we want to build something open-source and community-driven. We&#x27;re not a search or ads company, so we can focus on being privacy-first – Ollama integration, BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys), ad-blocker.<p>Btw we love what Brave started and stood for, but they&#x27;ve now spread themselves too thin across crypto, search, etc. We are laser-focused on one thing: making browsers work for YOU with AI. And unlike Arc (which we loved too but got abandoned), we&#x27;re 100% open source. Fork us if you don&#x27;t like our direction.<p>-- Our journey hacking a new browser\nTo build this, we had to fork Chromium. Honestly, it feels like the only viable path today—we&#x27;ve seen others like Brave (started with electron) and Microsoft Edge learn this the hard way.<p>We also started with why not just build an extension. But realized we needed more control. Similar to the reason why Cursor forked VSCode. For example, Chrome has this thing called the Accessibility Tree - basically a cleaner, semantic version of the DOM that screen readers use. Perfect for AI agents to understand pages, but you can&#x27;t use it through extension APIs.<p>That said, working with the 15M-line C++ chromium codebase has been an adventure. We&#x27;ve both worked on infra at Google and Meta, but Chromium is a different beast. Tools like Cursor&#x27;s indexing completely break at this scale, so we&#x27;ve had to get really good with grep and vim. And the build times are brutal—even with our maxed-out M4 Max MacBook, a full build takes about 3 hours.<p>Full disclosure: we are still very early, but we have a working prototype on GitHub. It includes an early version of a &quot;local Manus&quot; style agent that can automate simple web tasks, plus an AI sidebar for questions, and other productivity features (grouping tabs, saving&#x2F;resuming sessions, etc.).<p>Looking forward to any and all comments!<p>You can download the browser from our github page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nxtscape&#x2F;nxtscape\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nxtscape&#x2F;nxtscape</a>",

Now I think it has enough features to present it to the world (and a docker image to give it a quick try).<p>I know some people see trackers as relics of the past now that DHT and PEX are common but I think they still serve a purpose in today&#x27;s Internet (purely talking about public trackers). That said there is not a lot going on in terms of new developments since everyone just throws opentracker in a vps a calls it a day (honorable exceptions: aquatic and torrust).<p>I plan to continue development for the foreseeable future and add some (optional) esoteric features along the way so if anyone currently operates a tracker please give a try and enjoy the lack of crashes.<p>note: only swarm_printout.ex has been vibe coded, the rest has all been written by hand.",

Most existing tools are either too expensive, too restrictive, or require custom layers (like custom Python servers for pre processing queries and embeddings). I wanted something API first, developer friendly, and easy to self host or use out of the box.<p>This is the first release, and I would love your feedback. Would you use this? What is missing for your use case?<p>Here is the README with all the links <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vpuna&#x2F;vpuna-ai-search\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vpuna&#x2F;vpuna-ai-search</a><p>Thank you for your time.",

You define your data model using SQLAlchemy, APIs, or custom logic, and EnrichMCP turns it into a type-safe, introspectable interface that agents can discover, traverse, and invoke.<p>It auto-generates tools from your models, validates all I&#x2F;O with Pydantic, handles relationships, and supports schema discovery. Agents can go from user → orders → product naturally, just like a developer navigating an ORM.<p>We use this internally to let agents query production systems, call APIs, apply business logic, and even integrate ML models. It works out of the box with SQLAlchemy and is easy to extend to any data source.<p>If you&#x27;re building agentic systems or anything AI-native, I&#x27;d love your feedback.

      "text": "I&#x27;ve found it helps PR reviewers when they can look through a set of commits with clear messages and logically organized changes. Typically reviewers prefer a larger quantity of smaller changes versus a smaller quantity of larger changes. Sometimes it gets really messy to break up a change into sufficiently small PRs, so thoughtful commits are a great way of further subdividing changes in PRs. It can be pretty time consuming to do this though, so this tool automates the process with the help of AI.<p>The tool sends the diff of your git branch against a base branch to an LLM provider. The LLM provider responds with a set of suggested commits with sensible commit messages, change groupings, and descriptions. When you explicitly accept the proposed changes, the tool re-writes the commit history on your branch to match the LLM&#x27;s suggestion. Then you can force push your branch to your remote to make it match.<p>The default AI provider is your locally running Ollama server. Cloud providers can be explicitly configured via CLI argument or in a config file, but keeping local models as the default helps to protect against unintentional data sharing. The tool always creates a backup branch in case you need to easily revert in case of changing your mind or an error in commit re-writing. Note that re-writing commit history to a remote branch requires a force push, which is something your team&#x2F;org will need to be ok with. As long as you are working on a feature branch this is usually fine, but it&#x27;s always worth checking if you are not sure.",
