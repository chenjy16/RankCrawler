      "text": "I&#x27;ve been building AI agents for a while. After trying every framework out there and talking to many founders building with AI, I&#x27;ve noticed something interesting: most &quot;AI Agents&quot; that make it to production aren&#x27;t actually that agentic. The best ones are mostly just well-engineered software with LLMs sprinkled in at key points.<p>So I set out to document what I&#x27;ve learned about building production-grade AI systems: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;humanlayer&#x2F;12-factor-agents\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;humanlayer&#x2F;12-factor-agents</a>. It&#x27;s a set of principles for building LLM-powered software that&#x27;s reliable enough to put in the hands of production customers.<p>In the spirit of Heroku&#x27;s 12 Factor Apps (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;12factor.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;12factor.net&#x2F;</a>), these principles focus on the engineering practices that make LLM applications more reliable, scalable, and maintainable. Even as models get exponentially more powerful, these core techniques will remain valuable.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many SaaS builders try to pivot towards AI by building greenfield new projects on agent frameworks, only to find that they couldn&#x27;t get things past the 70-80% reliability bar with out-of-the-box tools. The ones that did succeed tended to take small, modular concepts from agent building, and incorporate them into their existing product, rather than starting from scratch.<p>The full guide goes into detail on each principle with examples and patterns to follow. I&#x27;ve seen these practices work well in production systems handling real user traffic.<p>I&#x27;m sharing this as a starting point—the field is moving quickly so these principles will evolve. I welcome your feedback and contributions to help figure out what &quot;production grade&quot; means for AI systems!",

I’m Dane, the creator of Plandex (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plandex-ai&#x2F;plandex\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plandex-ai&#x2F;plandex</a>), an open source AI coding agent focused especially on tackling large tasks in real world software projects.<p>You can watch a 2 minute demo of Plandex in action here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SFSu2vNmlLk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SFSu2vNmlLk</a><p>And here’s more of a tutorial style demo showing how Plandex can automatically debug a browser application: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VCegxOCAPq0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VCegxOCAPq0</a><p>I launched Plandex v1 here on HN a little less than a year ago (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39918500\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39918500</a>).<p>Now I’m launching a major update, Plandex v2, which is the result of 8 months of heads down work, and is in effect a whole new project&#x2F;product.<p>In short, Plandex is now a top-tier coding agent with fully autonomous capabilities. It combines models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google to achieve better results, more reliable agent behavior, better cost efficiency, and better performance than is possible by using only a single provider’s models.<p>I believe it is now one of the best tools available for working on large tasks in real world codebases with AI. It has an effective context window of 2M tokens, and can index projects of 20M tokens and beyond using tree-sitter project maps (30+ languages are supported). It can effectively find relevant context in massive million-line projects like SQLite, Redis, and Git.<p>A bit more on some of Plandex’s key features:<p>- Plandex has a built-in diff review sandbox that helps you get the benefits of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project. By default, all changes accumulate in the sandbox until you approve them. The sandbox is version-controlled. You can rewind it to any previous point, and you can also create branches to try out alternative approaches.<p>- It offers a ‘full auto mode’ that can complete large tasks autonomously end-to-end, including high level planning, context loading, detailed planning, implementation, command execution (for dependencies, builds, tests, etc.), and debugging.<p>- The autonomy level is highly configurable. You can move up and down the ladder of autonomy depending on the task, your comfort level, and how you weigh cost optimization vs. effort and results.<p>- Models and model settings are also very configurable. There are built-in models and model packs for different use cases. You can also add custom models and model packs, and customize model settings like temperature or top-p. All model changes are version controlled, so you can use branches to try out the same task with different models. The newly released OpenAI models and the paid Gemini 2.5 Pro model will be integrated in the default model pack soon.<p>- It can be easily self-hosted, including a ‘local mode’ for a very fast local single-user setup with Docker.<p>- Cloud hosting is also available for added convenience with a couple of subscription tiers: an ‘Integrated Models’ mode that requires no other accounts or API keys and allows you to manage billing&#x2F;budgeting&#x2F;spending alerts and track usage centrally, and a ‘BYO API Key’ mode that allows you to use your own OpenAI&#x2F;OpenRouter accounts.<p>I’d love to get more HNers in the Plandex Discord (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;plandex-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;plandex-ai</a>). Please join and say hi!<p>And of course I’d love to hear your feedback, whether positive or negative. Thanks so much!",

      "text": "Hi HN — we’re Nathalie, Dalton, Vince, and Matt, and we’re launching Jasmine Energy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jasmine.energy\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jasmine.energy</a>), a tool that helps residential and commercial solar owners automatically register their systems, track energy generation, and get paid for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).<p>RECs are tradeable certificates for clean electricity, issued by energy markets across the US. Most people with rooftop or small commercial solar have never heard of them, let alone claimed them, but they’re real! They are typically bought by utilities or companies to meet climate targets.<p>The problem is, the process to claim and sell RECs is a mess—designed decades ago for utility-scale players, not individuals or small businesses.<p>To register a system and start claiming RECs, you usually have to: Navigate one of 10+ regional REC registries, each with its own documentation, forms, and rules; Pull generation data from your inverter or utility, format it, and submit it manually; Try to find a buyer (often through a broker or opaque exchange) and negotiate payment.<p>That takes weeks if not months for a single system, and most people give up. As a result, millions of solar installations leave income on the table every year. We started Jasmine Energy after seeing this firsthand: some of us worked in energy startups, and others watched our parents install solar but never claim a single REC.<p>Jasmine automates all of this. Our platform: Extracts metadata from your solar documents using AI and auto-registers your system in the correct registry; Connects to your inverter to submit generation data and verify REC eligibility; Lists RECs for sale through partners, tracks the sale process, and issues payouts—all through a single dashboard.<p>This domain is a good fit for automation and LLMs—not to generate text, but to (1) structure unstructured documents, (2) interact with legacy government websites where there’s no API, and (3) deal with repetitive bureaucratic language.<p>To be clear, we’re not trying to “squeeze public funding” or take unfair advantage of the system. REC sales happen in voluntary and compliance markets (usually funded by corporate buyers and utilities, not taxpayers). Jasmine doesn’t create or inflate incentives—it just helps people claim what already exists but is hard to access. We’re making the REC market more efficient.<p>RECs have been one of the most effective and widely adopted incentive systems to drive grid decarbonization. We’re excited to be making them easier to access.<p>The product is live now for solar owners in PJM, M-RETS, and ERCOT territories (more coming soon). If you already have solar, you can upload your docs and start the process at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.jasmine.energy\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.jasmine.energy</a>.<p>We’d love feedback from this community—on the product, the market, or any edge cases you think we should worry about. And of course we’ll be happy to answer any questions!",

No warning, no notification, just gone.<p>Naturally, people thought this was a new policy.<p>So they asked support.<p>And here’s where it gets batshit: Cursor has a support email, so users emailed them to find out. The support peson told everyone this was “expected behavior” under their new login policy.<p>One problem. There was no support team, it was an AI designed to &#x27;mimic human responses&#x27;<p>That answer, totally made up by the bot, spread like wildfire.<p>Users assumed it was real (because why wouldn’t they? It&#x27;s their own support system lol), and within hours the community was in revolt. Dozens of users publicly canceled their subscriptions, myself included. Multi-device workflows are table stakes for devs, and if you&#x27;re going to pull something that disruptive, you&#x27;d at least expect a changelog entry or smth.<p>Nope.<p>And just as people started comparing notes and figuring out that the story didn’t quite add up… the main Reddit thread got locked. Then deleted. Like, no public resolution, no real response, just silence.<p>To be clear: this wasn’t an actual policy change, just a backend session bug, and a hallucinated excuse from a support bot that somehow did more damage than the bug itself.<p>But at that point, it didn’t matter. People were already gone.<p>Honestly one of the most surreal product screwups I’ve seen in a while. Not because they made a mistake, but because the AI support system invented a lie, and nobody caught it until the userbase imploded.",

      "text": "Hey HN, we’re building mrge (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home</a>), an AI code review platform to help teams merge code faster with fewer bugs. Our early users include Better Auth, Cal.com, and n8n—teams that handle a lot of PRs every day.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY</a><p>We (Allis and Paul) are engineers who faced this problem when we worked together at our last startup. Code review quickly became our biggest bottleneck—especially as we started using AI to code more. We had more PRs to review, subtle AI-written bugs slipped through unnoticed, and we (humans) increasingly found ourselves rubber-stamping PRs without deeply understanding the changes.<p>We’re building mrge to help solve that. Here’s how it works:<p>1. Connect your GitHub repo via our Github app in two clicks (and optionally download our desktop app). Gitlab support is on the roadmap!<p>2. AI Review: When you open a PR, our AI reviews your changes directly in an ephemeral and secure container. It has context into not just that PR, but your whole codebase, so it can pick up patterns and leave comments directly on changed lines. Once the review is done, the sandbox is torn down and your code deleted – we don’t store it for obvious reasons.<p>3. Human-friendly review workflow: Jump into our web app (it’s like Linear but for PRs). Changes are grouped logically (not alphabetically), with important diffs highlighted, visualized, and ready for faster human review.<p>The AI reviewer works a bit like Cursor in the sense that it navigates your codebase using the same tools a developer would—like jumping to definitions or grepping through code.<p>But a big challenge was that, unlike Cursor, mrge doesn’t run in your local IDE or editor. We had to recreate something similar entirely in the cloud.<p>Whenever you open a PR, mrge clones your repository and checks out your branch in a secure and isolated temporary sandbox.  We provision this sandbox with shell access and a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server. The AI reviewer then reviews your code, navigating the codebase exactly as a human reviewer would—using shell commands and common editor features like &quot;go to definition&quot; or &quot;find references&quot;. When the review finishes, we immediately tear down the sandbox and delete the code—we don’t want to permanently store it for obvious reasons.<p>We know cloud-based review isn&#x27;t for everyone, especially if security or compliance requires local deployments. But a cloud approach lets us run SOTA AI models without local GPU setups, and provide a consistent, single AI review per PR for an entire team.<p>The platform itself focuses entirely on making <i>human</i> code reviews easier. A big inspiration came from productivity-focused apps like Linear or Superhuman, products that show just how much thoughtful design can impact everyday workflows. We wanted to bring that same feeling into code review.<p>That’s one reason we built a desktop app. It allowed us to deliver a more polished experience, complete with keyboard shortcuts and a snappy interface.<p>Beyond performance, the main thing we care about is making it easier for humans to read and understand code. For example, traditional review tools sort changed files alphabetically—which forces reviewers to figure out the order in which they should review changes. In mrge, files are automatically grouped and ordered based on logical connections, letting reviewers immediately jump in.<p>We think the future of coding isn’t about AI replacing humans—it’s about giving us better tools to quickly understand high-level changes, abstracting more and more of the code itself. As code volume continues to increase, this shift is going to become increasingly important.<p>You can sign up now (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home</a>). mrge is currently free while we&#x27;re still early. Our plan for later is to charge closed-source projects on a per-seat basis, and to continue giving mrge away for free to open source ones.<p>We’re very actively building and would love your honest feedback!",

I&#x27;ve searched around for a while and i cant find anything like that that can handle thousands of people streaming. The closest is probably Webrtc and that looks like it can only handle 500~ peers.<p>I was thinking most people nowaday have at least 30mbps upload and a 1080p stream only needs ~10mbps and 720p needs ~5ish. Also i think it wouldnt have to be live, people would definitely not mind some amount of lag. I was thinking the big O for packets propagating out in the network should be Log(N) since if a master is sharing the content then is connected to 10 slaves, then those connected to 10 other slaves and so on.<p>The other limitation I could think of is prioritizing who gets the packets first since there&#x27;s a lot of people with 1gbs connections or &gt;10mbps connections. Also deprioritizing leechers to keep it from degrading the stream.<p>Does anyone have knowledge on why it isn&#x27;t a thing still though? it&#x27;s super easy to find streams on websites but they&#x27;re all 360p or barely load. I saw the original creator of bittorrent was creating something like this over 10 years ago and seems to be a dead project. Also this is ignoring the huge time commitment it would take to program something like this. I want to know if this is technically possible to have streams of lets say 100,000 people and why or why not.<p>Just some thoughts, thanks in advance!",
