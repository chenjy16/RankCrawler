They get what they need—but none of what they shouldn’t have.<p>We’re just getting started and I’d love to hear what you think, what you’d like to see next, and any feedback you have.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changefly.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changefly.com</a>",

      "text": "Hi HN, we’re Ben and Connor, the co-founders of Skope (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useskope.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useskope.com&#x2F;</a>), a billing system that supports outcome-based pricing for software—that is, which charges your customers only when your software actually works. We’re an alternative to Stripe Billing, Orb, and Metronome that natively supports this pricing model, because we believe it’s especially needed for the AI products which are flooding the market and that will continue to be built in the future.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ORxhACQbu64\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ORxhACQbu64</a><p>Prior to working on Skope, we built AI agents that fundraised for nonprofits. We weren’t able to find our stride within the nonprofit world, one reason being that there was no incentive for a nonprofit (with an already small budget) to take on the risk of buying expensive software claiming to replace humans at a high upfront cost, without proving its value first.<p>Instead, they should’ve been able to pay every time our product really worked (in this case by securing a donation or booking a meeting). With this model, we wouldn’t profit with a mediocre product. At the same time, we’d give ourselves more upside if what we were selling truly did its job. All while taking all the risk off of our buyers.<p>Although we really wanted to, there was no easy way to make this happen at scale. It would have had to rely on trust, and depend on every single customer reporting each outcome quickly and accurately. Not the best recipe.<p>So, we decided to build it…which turned out to mean rebuilding billing from scratch. We think a world where people pay for software doing its job is a good one, in which case outcome-based pricing will catch on, but don’t think it’ll happen overnight. There are a ton of wrinkles to figure out still. In the meantime, we’ve also built the rails to support traditional subscriptions and usage&#x2F;credit based models with a focus on making iteration on price really easy.<p>How it works: Our users can easily track customer usage through units (like tokens consumed or emails sent) and set pricing rules such as the price of each unit or a limit for usage per month. These pricing rules are designed to be flexible items that can be modified easily for each customer. Usage is recorded as events uploaded via our API&#x2F;SDK, which are mapped to pricing rules for accurate, immutable billing calculations. Invoices are automatically generated at the end of each billing period based on the events logged during the given period. We are working to develop integrations with LLM observability platforms such as Helicone and Langfuse to make it easy to record customer usage data. Finally, we make it easy to collect payments via Stripe (disconnected from Stripe Billing).<p>For outcomes specifically, we’re working on acting as a middle layer between our customers and their users. The same process for setting prices and units follows as said before, but we’ll have access to both our users’ and their customers’ systems of record to verify that these outcomes actually happened. We built a customer portal so that once outcomes are verified by us, the customer can see and validate them as they happen. If a customer of a company using Skope, wants to dispute a charge, we plan to handle it ourselves through the platform. Transparency and trust are really important between all parties within this model, so we want to do everything possible to encourage that.<p>We really like the outcome-based model because it encourages truly good software and aligns incentives between buyers and sellers. We think that the bar for software will become higher as more companies adopt it and it’ll lead to cool things. At the same time, neither buyers nor sellers can pull a fast one on the other to get a better deal. It’s similar to Google Ads, which introduced pay-per-click pricing to online advertising for the first time. We’re trying to make it possible for the entire software industry to come into the pay-per-performance realm, just like Google did 20 years ago.<p>We’re rolling out at a flat subscription price. Counterintuitively, we don’t think the outcome-based model makes sense for Skope itself. A billing product isn’t one that “may or may not work”, it needs to just work.<p>The way AI companies do business needs new billing infrastructure, and that&#x27;s what we’re working to provide. We have a ton to learn and are eager to hear how others see the future playing out.<p>Please let us know if you have any thoughts on things you’d like to see. Always excited to riff on this and we’d absolutely love your comments!",

But it&#x27;s been working surprisingly well for personal use. The entire index for a year of conversations fits in ~100MB RAM with sub-second retrieval.<p>The cool part: You can git checkout to any point in time and see exactly what the AI knew then. Perfect reproducibility, human-readable storage, and you can manually edit memories if needed.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Growth-Kinetics&#x2F;DiffMem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Growth-Kinetics&#x2F;DiffMem</a><p>Stack: Python, GitPython, rank-bm25, OpenRouter for LLM orchestration.

      "text": "Hi HN — we’re George and Alex, building Channel3 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com&#x2F;</a>), a database of every product on the internet, searchable via text&#x2F;image, and with built-in affiliate monetization. Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Mx8FyP7KvJg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Mx8FyP7KvJg</a>.<p>It’s surprisingly hard to find good product data. If you want your software to recommend products and deep-link to merchants, you’ll quickly discover that the data you need—clean titles, normalized attributes, deduped listings, current prices and inventory, variant options, images, and brand info—is not just messy; it’s also spread across a long, long tail of retailers, and often lives behind advanced bot-detection systems.<p>We ran into this problem while building an AI teacher that could recommend relevant supplies. We asked Exa for products, but got back articles, not structured data. Same for Tavily and Bing (deprecated as of 8&#x2F;13&#x2F;25). And we got rejected from affiliate programs, who suggested we come back with 1000s of TikTok followers. Channel3 is the API we wished we had.<p>Product detail pages (PDPs) usually present the main item alongside recommendations. We use computer vision to isolate the main product and find its attributes, like title and price. We apply the same logic to the rest of the PDPs on the domain.<p>Products are often sold across multiple retailers, with no guarantee they’ll be labeled consistently. We collapse products across the web into a canonicalized set by using LLMs and multimodal embeddings to actually understand each product.<p>To normalize everything into a schema that tries to be both minimal and extensible, we have to be opinionated. Are a $50 10” and $60 12” skillet the same product? Probably not, but the S&#x2F;M&#x2F;L variants of a T-shirt are. Our goal is that any product you’d search for specifically is treated as its own product.<p>We process a massive amount of data. We quickly ran out of room on our Cloudflare Vectorize indices and moved to the brand-new AWS S3 Vectors platform, syncing to OpenSearch for faster response times and more dynamic filtering. We hit rate limits constantly, so we spread our work over multiple cloud providers and AI models.<p>You can search things like “outdoor grill, less than $1000”, or “sweat-resistant, wireless running earbuds”, or\n&quot;women&#x27;s jeans from Paige that look like [<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gap.com&#x2F;webcontent&#x2F;0020&#x2F;666&#x2F;799&#x2F;cn20666799.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gap.com&#x2F;webcontent&#x2F;0020&#x2F;666&#x2F;799&#x2F;cn20666799.jpg</a>]”. Products come back as JSON with title, brand, images, price, specs, etc.<p>Developers earn commission on sales they drive (averaging 5%). Channel3 takes a cut. We want you to earn way more money from Channel3 than you spend on it. We win when you win.<p>We provide an API, SDK (Typescript and Python), and MCP. We offer 1000 free searches, and charge $7&#x2F;1000 searches after that. You can view expected commissions per-brand on our dashboard.<p>So far, products are US-only (sorry! we will expand). We’re live with millions of products and hundreds of developers.<p>To get started, make a free account at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com</a>, then select which brands you’d like to sell (choose from 50k+ or request your own), generate an API key, and start selling and earning.<p>We’d really appreciate feedback from this community. If you’ve built product search before, what did we miss in the schema? If you’ve tried to add commerce to an app, what blocked you? If you tried to build this yourself, what did you learn? Are there endpoints you wish existed (e.g. price alerts, back-in-stock webhooks, product feed)? For any suggestions, we’re all ears.<p>We’ll be in the thread all day to answer questions, share more technical detail, and hear whatever would make this most useful to you. Comment away!",

My friends Matthew, Jake and I are building Luminal (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luminalai.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luminalai.com&#x2F;</a>), a GPU compiler for automatically generating fast GPU kernels for AI models. It uses search-based compilation to achieve high performance.<p>We take high level model code, like you&#x27;d have in PyTorch, and generate very fast GPU code. We do that without using LLMs or AI - rather, we pose it as a search problem. Our compiler builds a search space, generates millions of possible kernels, and then searches through it to minimize runtime.<p>You can try out a demo in `demos&#x2F;matmul` on mac to see how Luminal takes a naive operation, represented in our IR of 12 simple operations, and compiles it to an optimized, tensor-core enabled Metal kernel. Here’s a video showing how: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;P2oNR8zxSAA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;P2oNR8zxSAA</a><p>Our approach differs significantly from traditional ML libraries in that we ahead-of-time compile everything, generate a large search space of logically-equivalent kernels, and search through it to find the fastest kernels. This allows us to leverage the Bitter Lesson to discover complex optimizations like Flash Attention entirely automatically without needing manual heuristics. The best rule is no rule, the best heuristic is no heuristic, just search everything.<p>We’re working on bringing CUDA support up to parity with Metal, adding more flexibility to the search space, adding full-model examples (like Llama), and adding very exotic hardware backends.<p>We aim to radically simplify the ML ecosystem while improving performance and hardware utilization. Please check out our repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;luminal-ai&#x2F;luminal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;luminal-ai&#x2F;luminal</a> and I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I built PlutoPrint because I needed a simple way to generate beautiful PDFs and images directly from HTML with Python. Most of the tools I tried felt heavy, tricky to set up, or produced results that didn’t look great, so I wanted something lightweight, modern, and fast. PlutoPrint is built on top of PlutoBook’s rendering engine, which is designed for paged media, and then wrapped with a Python API that makes it easy to turn HTML or XML into crisp PDFs and PNGs. I’ve used it for things like invoices, reports, tickets, and even snapshots, and it can also integrate with Matplotlib to render charts directly into documents.<p>I’d be glad to hear what you think. If you’ve ever had to wrestle with generating PDFs or images from HTML, I hope this feels like a smoother option. Feedback, ideas, or even just impressions are all very welcome, and I’d love to learn how PlutoPrint could be more useful for you.",
