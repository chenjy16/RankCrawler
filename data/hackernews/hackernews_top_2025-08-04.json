      "text": "Hi HN,\nI’ve always struggled with impulse buying—that late-night Amazon scroll or the &quot;deal&quot; that&#x27;s too good to pass up. I realized I was trading long-term goals for short-term dopamine hits. The core problem is the frictionlessness of modern e-commerce.<p>To fight back, I built Nope It. It’s not just another budgeting app. It&#x27;s a PWA designed to interrupt the impulse loop at the critical moment.<p>How it works is based on a few key psychological principles:<p>Forced Pause (The Cooldown): Inspired by Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow,&quot; the app introduces a mandatory 24-hour cooldown on any logged impulse. This shifts you from impulsive &quot;System 1&quot; thinking to deliberate &quot;System 2&quot; thinking.<p>Cost Re-framing (Work Hours Psychology): It immediately translates the item&#x27;s price into a more tangible metric: This $80 gadget costs you 4 hours of your work. This technique, known as &quot;opportunity cost visualization,&quot; makes the trade-off much more real.<p>Goal Redirection: Instead of just saying &quot;no,&quot; the app encourages you to immediately contribute the saved amount to a pre-defined Wishlist Goal (e.g., &quot;Vacation Fund,&quot; &quot;Down Payment&quot;). This replaces the lost dopamine from buying with the positive feeling of making progress.<p>The Tech:<p>It&#x27;s built as an enterprise-grade behavioral platform, but the front-end is a simple, fast Progressive Web Application (PWA) so there&#x27;s nothing to install. It&#x27;s accessible on any device, instantly.<p>I wanted to turn a personal weakness into a strength and thought others might find it useful too. I&#x27;m here to answer any questions about the psychology, the tech, or the journey.<p>Would love to get your feedback!<p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nopeit.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nopeit.app</a>",

      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I wanted to share something I&#x27;ve been working on for the past couple of months, which may be interesting to developers interacting with distributed architectures (e.g., microservices).<p>I&#x27;m a backend developer, and in my 9-5 job last year, we started building a distributed app - by that, I mean two or more services communicating via some sort of messaging system, like Kafka. This was my first foray into distributed systems. Having been exposed to structured concurrency by Nathan J. Smith&#x27;s beautiful article on the subject (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vorpus.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vorpus.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-g...</a>), I started noticing the similarities between the challenges of this message-based communication, and that of concurrent programming, and GOTO-based programming before that - actions at a distance, non-trivial tracing of failures, synchronization issues, etc. I started suspecting that if the symptoms were similar, maybe the root cause, and therefore the solution, could be as well.<p>This led me to design something I&#x27;m calling &quot;structured cooperation&quot;, which is basically what you get when you apply the principles of structured concurrency to distributed systems. It&#x27;s something like a &quot;protocol&quot;, in the sense that it&#x27;s basically a set of rules, and not tied to any particular language or framework. As it turns out, obeying those rules has some pretty powerful consequences, including:<p>- Pretty much eliminates race conditions caused by eventual consistency<p>- Allows you to recover something resembling distributed exceptions - stack traces and the equivalent of stack unwinding, but across service boundaries<p>- Makes it much easier to reason about the system as a whole<p>I put together three articles that explain:<p>1) what structured cooperation is (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.porn&#x2F;posts&#x2F;introducing-structured-cooperation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.porn&#x2F;posts&#x2F;introducing-structured-cooperat...</a>),<p>2) one way you could implement it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.porn&#x2F;posts&#x2F;implementing-structured-cooperation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.porn&#x2F;posts&#x2F;implementing-structured-coopera...</a>), and<p>3) why it works (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.porn&#x2F;posts&#x2F;framing-structured-cooperation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.porn&#x2F;posts&#x2F;framing-structured-cooperation&#x2F;</a>).<p>I also put together a heavily documented POC implementation in Kotlin, called Scoop (linked in the title). I guess you could call it an orchestration library, similar to e.g. Temporal (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temporal.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;temporal.io&#x2F;</a>), although I want to stress that it&#x27;s just a POC, and not meant for production use.<p>I was hoping to bounce this idea off the community and see what people think. If it turns out to be a useful way of doing things, I&#x27;d try and drive the implementation of something similar in existing libraries (e.g. the aforementioned Temporal, Axon (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axoniq.io&#x2F;products&#x2F;axon-framework\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axoniq.io&#x2F;products&#x2F;axon-framework</a>), etc. - let me know if you know of others where this would make sense). As I mention in the articles, due to the heterogeneous nature of the technological landscape, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a good idea to actually try to build a library, in the same way as it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to do a &quot;structured concurrency library&quot;, since there are many ways that &quot;concurrency&quot; is implemented. Rather, I tried to build something like a &quot;reference implementation&quot; that other people can use as a stepping stone to build their own implementations.<p>Above and beyond that, I think that this has educational value as well, and I did my best to make everything as understandable as possible. Some things I think are interesting:<p>- Implementation of distributed coroutines on top of Postgres<p>- Has both reactive and blocking implementation, so can be used as a learning resource for people new to reactive<p>- I documented various interesting issues that arise when you use Postgres as an MQ (see, in particular, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gabrielshanahan&#x2F;scoop&#x2F;blob&#x2F;09db323bf6c8a72ca34b50392928db13f80dcc15&#x2F;src&#x2F;main&#x2F;resources&#x2F;db&#x2F;migration&#x2F;V2__create_message_event_table.sql#L20\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gabrielshanahan&#x2F;scoop&#x2F;blob&#x2F;09db323bf6c8a7...</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gabrielshanahan&#x2F;scoop&#x2F;blob&#x2F;09db323bf6c8a72ca34b50392928db13f80dcc15&#x2F;src&#x2F;main&#x2F;kotlin&#x2F;io&#x2F;github&#x2F;gabrielshanahan&#x2F;scoop&#x2F;blocking&#x2F;coroutine&#x2F;structuredcooperation&#x2F;MessageEventRepository.kt#L676\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gabrielshanahan&#x2F;scoop&#x2F;blob&#x2F;09db323bf6c8a7...</a>)<p>Let me know what you think.",

Artificial Societies (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io</a>) lets you simulate your target audience so you can test marketing, messaging and content before you launch them.<p>Here’s a quick product demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c0ce8ab860c044c586c13a24b6c9b391?sid=b7b4e23c-5223-4aad-ae08-b5c704d45aad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c0ce8ab860c044c586c13a24b6c9b391?...</a><p>Marketers always say that half their spend will be wasted - they just don’t know which half. Real-world experiments help, but they’re too slow and expensive to run at scale. So, we’re building simulations that let you test rapidly and cheaply to find the best version of your message.<p>How it works:<p>- We create AI personas based on real-world data from actual individuals, collected from publicly available social media profiles and web sources.<p>- For each audience, we retrieve relevant personas from our database and map them out on an interactive social network graph, which is designed to replicate patterns of social influence.<p>- Once you’ve drafted your message, each experiment runs a multi-agent simulation where the personas react to your content and interact with each other - these take 30s to 2 minutes to run. Then, we then surface results and insights to help you improve your messaging.<p>Our two biggest challenges are accuracy and UI. We’ve tested our performance at predicting how LinkedIn posts perform, and the initial results have been promising. Our model has an R2 of 0.78 and we’ve found that “message spread” in our simulations is the single most important predictor of actual engagements when looking at posts made by the same authors. But there’s a long way to go in generalising these simulations to other contexts, and finding ground truth data for evals. We have some more info on accuracy here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io&#x2F;#accuracy\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io&#x2F;#accuracy</a><p>In terms of UI, our biggest challenge is figuring out whether the ‘experiment’ form factor is attractive to users. We’ve deliberately focused on this (over AI surveys) as experiments leverage our expertise in social influence and how ideas spread between personas.<p>James and I are both behavioral scientists by training but took different paths to get here. I helped businesses run A&#x2F;B tests to boost sales and retention. Meanwhile, James became a data scientist and, in his spare time, hooked together 33,000 LLM chatbots and wrote a paper about it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfdirect&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;bjop.12764\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfdirect&#x2F;10....</a>). He showed me the simulations and we decided to make a startup out of it.<p>Pricing: Artificial Societies is free to try. New users get 3 free credits and then a two week free trial. Pro accounts get unlimited simulations for $40&#x2F;month. We’re planning on introducing teams later, and enterprise pricing for custom-built audiences.<p>We’d love you to give the tool a try and share your thoughts!",
