      "text": "(spoiler: its XSLT)<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a little demo for how to avoid copy-pasting header&#x2F;footer boilerplate on a simple static webpage. My goal is to approximate the experience of Jekyll&#x2F;Hugo but eliminate the need for a build step before publishing. This demo shows how to get basic templating features with XSL so you could write a blog post which looks like<p><pre><code>  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n  &lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text&#x2F;xsl&quot; href=&quot;&#x2F;template.xsl&quot;?&gt;\n  &lt;page&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;My Article&lt;&#x2F;title&gt;\n      &lt;content&gt;\n          some content\n          &lt;ul&gt;\n              &lt;li&gt;hello&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;\n              &lt;li&gt;hello&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;\n          &lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;\n      &lt;&#x2F;content&gt;\n  &lt;&#x2F;page&gt;\n</code></pre>\nSome properties which set this approach apart from other methods:<p><pre><code>  - no build step (no need to setup Jekyll on the client or configure Github&#x2F;Gitlab actions)\n  - works on any webserver (e.g. as opposed to server-side includes, actions)\n  - normal looking URLs (e.g. `example.com&#x2F;foobar` as opposed to `example.com&#x2F;#page=foobar`)\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s been some talk about removing XSLT support from the HTML spec [0], so I figured I would show this proof of concept while it still works.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44952185\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44952185</a><p>See also: grug-brain XSLT <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44393817\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44393817</a>",

      "text": "Hey HN, we&#x27;re Phil, Ian and Jonny, and we&#x27;re building BlankBio (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blank.bio\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blank.bio</a>). We&#x27;re training RNA foundation models to power a computational toolkit for therapeutics. The first application is in mRNA design where our vision is for any biologist to design an effective therapeutic sequence (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZgI7WJ1SygI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZgI7WJ1SygI</a>).<p>BlankBio started from our PhD work in this area, which is open-sourced. There’s a model [2] and a benchmark with APIs access [0].<p>mRNA has the potential to encode vaccines, gene therapies, and cancer treatments. Yet designing effective mRNA remains a bottleneck. Today, scientists design mRNA by manually editing sequences AUGCGUAC... and testing the results through trial and error. It&#x27;s like writing assembly code and managing individual memory addresses. The field is flooded with capital aimed at therapeutics companies: Strand ($153M), Orna ($221M), Sail Biomedicines ($440M) but the tooling to approach these problems remains low-level. That’s what we’re aiming to solve.<p>The big problem is that mRNA sequences are incomprehensible. They encode properties like half-life (how long RNA survives in cells) and translation efficiency (protein output), but we don&#x27;t know how to optimize them. To get effective treatments, we need more precision. Scientists need sequences that target specific cell types to reduce dosage and side effects.<p>We envision a future where RNA designers operate at a higher level of abstraction. Imagine code like this:<p><pre><code>  seq = &quot;AUGCAUGCAUGC...&quot;\n  seq = BB.half_life(seq, target=&quot;6 hours&quot;)\n  seq = BB.cell_type(seq, target=&quot;hepatocytes&quot;)\n  seq = BB.expression(seq, level=&quot;high&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nTo get there we need generalizable RNA embeddings from pre-trained models. During our PhDs, Ian and I worked on self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives for RNA. This approach allows us to train on unlabeled data and has advantages: (1) we don&#x27;t require noisy experimental data, and (2) the amount of unlabeled data is significantly greater than labeled. However the challenge is that standard NLP approaches don&#x27;t work well on genomic sequences.<p>Using joint embedding architecture approaches (contrastive learning), we trained model to recognize functionally similar sequences rather than predict every nucleotide. This worked remarkably well. Our 10M parameter model, Orthrus, trained on 4 GPUs for 14 hours, beats Evo2, a 40B parameter model trained on 1000 GPUs for a month [0]. On mRNA half-life prediction, just by fitting a linear regression on our embeddings, we outperform supervised models. This work done during our academic days is the foundation for what we&#x27;re building. We&#x27;re improving training algorithms, growing the pre-training dataset, and making use of parameter scaling with the goal of designing effective mRNA therapeutics.<p>We have a lot to say about why other SSL approaches work better than next-token prediction and masked language modeling: some of which you can check out in Ian&#x27;s blog post [1] and our paper [2]. The big takeaway is that the current approaches of applying NLP to scaling models for biological sequences won&#x27;t get us all the way there. 90% of the genome can mutate without affecting fitness so training models to predict this noisy sequence results in suboptimal embeddings [3].<p>We think there are strong parallels between the digital and RNA revolutions. In the early days of computing, programmers wrote assembly code, managing registers and memory addresses directly. Today&#x27;s RNA designers are manually tweaking sequences, improving stability or reduce immunogenicity through trial and error. As compilers freed programmers from low-level details, we&#x27;re building the abstraction layer for RNA.<p>We currently have pilots with a few early stage biotechs proving out utility of our embeddings and our open source model is used by folks at Sanofi &amp; GSK. We&#x27;re looking for: (1) partners working on RNA adjacent modalities (2) feedback from anyone who&#x27;s tried to design RNA sequences what were your pain points?, and (3) Ideas for other applications! We chatted with some biomarker providing companies, and some preliminary analyses demonstrate improved stratification.<p>Thanks for reading. Happy to answer questions about the technical approach, why genomics is different from language, or anything else.<p>- Phil, Ian, and Jonny<p>founders@blankbio.com<p>[0] mRNABench: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2025.07.05.662870v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2025.07.05.662870v1</a><p>[1] Ian’s Blog on Scaling: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quietflamingo.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;scaling-is-dead-long-live-scaling\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quietflamingo.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;scaling-is-dead-long-li...</a><p>[2] Orthrus: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2024.10.10.617658v3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2024.10.10.617658v3</a><p>[3] Zoonomia: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.abn3943\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.abn3943</a>",

      "text": "Hi HN, we are Liam and Eoghan of Inconvo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inconvo.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inconvo.com</a>), a platform that makes it easy to build and deploy AI analytics agents into your SaaS products, so your customers can quickly interact with their data.<p>There’s a demo video at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4wlZL3XGWTQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4wlZL3XGWTQ</a> and a live demo at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.inconvo.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.inconvo.ai&#x2F;</a> (no signup required). Docs are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inconvo.com&#x2F;docs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inconvo.com&#x2F;docs</a>.<p>SaaS products typically offer dashboards and reports, which work for high-level metrics but are clunky for drill-downs and slow for ad-hoc questions. Modern users, shaped by tools like ChatGPT, now expect a similar degree of speed and flexibility when getting insights from their data. To meet these expectations, you need an AI analytics agent, but these are painful to develop and manage.<p>Inconvo is a platform built from the ground up for developers building AI agents for customer-facing analytics. We make it simple to expose data to Inconvo by connecting to SQL databases. We offer a semantic model to create a layer that governs data access and defines business logic, conversation logs to track user interactions, and a developer-friendly API for easy integration. For observability we show a trace for each agent response to make agent behaviour easily debuggable.<p>We didn’t start out building Inconvo, initially we built a developer productivity SaaS from which we pivoted. Our favourite feature of that product was its analytics agent, and we knew that building one was a big enough problem to solve on its own so we decided to build a developer tool to do so.<p>Our API is designed for multi-tenant databases, allowing you to pass session information as context. This instructs the agent to only analyse data relevant to the specific tenant making the request.<p>Most of our competitors are BI tools primarily designed for internal analytics with limited embedding options through iFrame or unintuitive APIs.<p>If you’re concerned about AI SQL generation, we are too. In our opinion, AI agents for customer-facing analytics shouldn’t generate and run raw SQL without validation. Instead, our agents generate structured query objects that are programmatically validated to guarantee they request only the data allowed within the context of the request. Then we send validated objects to our QueryEngine which converts the object to SQL. With this approach we ensure a bounded set of possible SQL that can be generated, which stops the agent from hallucinating and running rouge queries.<p>Our pricing is upfront and available on our website. You can try the platform for free without a credit card.<p>If you want to try out the full product, you can sign up for free at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth.inconvo.ai&#x2F;en&#x2F;signup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth.inconvo.ai&#x2F;en&#x2F;signup</a>. As mentioned, our sandbox demo is at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.inconvo.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.inconvo.ai&#x2F;</a>, and there’s a video at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4wlZL3XGWTQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4wlZL3XGWTQ</a>.<p>We&#x27;re really interested in any feedback you have so please share your thoughts and ideas in the comments, as we aim to make this tool as developer-friendly as possible. Thanks!",

I’m Christian, daily lurker and some might remember our original launch post (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42935355\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42935355</a>). Today we&#x27;re launching Pinch for Mac, which we believe is a step-change improvement in real-time AI translation. Our vision is to make cross-lingual conversations feel as natural as regular conversations.<p>TL:DR \nDuring an online meeting, the app instantly transcribes and translates all audio you hear, and allows you to decide when you translate your voice and when you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s invisible to others (like Granola), and works everywhere without any meeting bots. Try it at startpinch.com<p>Here&#x27;s a live demo we recorded this morning, without cuts: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ltM2p-SosLc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ltM2p-SosLc</a><p>When we first launched Pinch, we shipped a video conferencing solution with a human-like AI interpreter that was an active participant in your call. Our users hold the spacebar down while speaking to the translator, and when they release the spacebar the translator speaks out to the entire room.<p>That design was intentional - it puts the task of context selection on the user and prevents people from interrupting each other awkwardly (only one person can press spacebar at a time). It also comes with heavy tradeoffs, namely:<p>* Latency - Up to 2x longer meeting lengths due to everyone hearing your full sentence and then the translation of your full sentence<p>* Friction with first-time users - Customers using Pinch for external communication often meet with new people each time, and we&#x27;ve learned of several that send out an instruction doc pre-meeting on how to join and use translation in the Pinch call. Bad signal for our UX.<p>* Restricting our customers to those who are meeting creators<p>Benefits of the desktop app:<p>1. It creates a virtual microphone that you can use in any meeting app<p>2. Instant transcription+translation means you can understand what&#x27;s going on in real-time and interrupt where necessary<p>3. Simultaneous translation - after you start speaking, the others will hear your translated audio as fast as we can generate it, without interrupting your flow.<p>Over the last months our focus has been on developing a model and UX to support high translation accuracy while automating context selection - knowing exactly when it has enough words to start the translated sentence. We’ve rolled this out to the desktop app first.<p>We&#x27;re incredibly excited to go public beta today, you can give it a try at www.startpinch.com<p>Cheers,\n- Christian",

What&#x27;s forefront on your mind with regards to the human predicament, and how we move forward? \nWe all see that it seems pretty much everyone has gone insane, or at least that&#x27;s what the narrative portrays. Why are companies, governments, and other organizations doing such stupid things? \nSo we&#x27;ve made machines that can appear to &quot;think&quot;, by articulating linguistic constructs that make sense. In fact, there appears to be actual semantic and logical structure embedded within the neural networks of LLMs. Ok, let&#x27;s keep our heads on straight, keep in mind the mathematics involved, chill out, and just think about what it is that we actually want (and what &quot;we&quot; are, for that matter). Are we going to someday transcend language? I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m typing this message out to you, using language, with hopes that this form of communication will become obsolete. But what will that look like? I know that human language in it&#x27;s current form is severely limited. \nIf we&#x27;re to design some future communication protocol and methodology, let&#x27;s contemplate what types of things even need to be communicated? For example, what is &quot;the news&quot; nowadays? Could it be simply a video stream of the sunrise? Well it would take a long time to get there. In the meantime, it should probably be something like &quot;yeah, it&#x27;s another day, and humans are doing the work necessary to put order to chaos and make things better for everyone&quot;.<p>From a more concrete perspective, I&#x27;d say that we&#x27;ve reached the point when we can transcend the idea of what &quot;work&quot; is currently. We can see beyond the limited view of doing things for monetary profit, and see that certain systems could be implemented much better if there were certain forms of entity-organization and resource-allocation at play. What is a company if it&#x27;s ran by a computer? What does it serve? I mean, it sounds silly to suggest some big companies with overlapping domains of operation should consolidate their operations, but we all know that that&#x27;s where things should be headed in many cases.<p>So yeah, what&#x27;s your vision for the future?",

      "text": "Hi HN — we’re George and Alex, building Channel3 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com&#x2F;</a>), a database of every product on the internet, searchable via text&#x2F;image, and with built-in affiliate monetization. Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Mx8FyP7KvJg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Mx8FyP7KvJg</a>.<p>It’s surprisingly hard to find good product data. If you want your software to recommend products and deep-link to merchants, you’ll quickly discover that the data you need—clean titles, normalized attributes, deduped listings, current prices and inventory, variant options, images, and brand info—is not just messy; it’s also spread across a long, long tail of retailers, and often lives behind advanced bot-detection systems.<p>We ran into this problem while building an AI teacher that could recommend relevant supplies. We asked Exa for products, but got back articles, not structured data. Same for Tavily and Bing (deprecated as of 8&#x2F;13&#x2F;25). And we got rejected from affiliate programs, who suggested we come back with 1000s of TikTok followers. Channel3 is the API we wished we had.<p>Product detail pages (PDPs) usually present the main item alongside recommendations. We use computer vision to isolate the main product and find its attributes, like title and price. We apply the same logic to the rest of the PDPs on the domain.<p>Products are often sold across multiple retailers, with no guarantee they’ll be labeled consistently. We collapse products across the web into a canonicalized set by using LLMs and multimodal embeddings to actually understand each product.<p>To normalize everything into a schema that tries to be both minimal and extensible, we have to be opinionated. Are a $50 10” and $60 12” skillet the same product? Probably not, but the S&#x2F;M&#x2F;L variants of a T-shirt are. Our goal is that any product you’d search for specifically is treated as its own product.<p>We process a massive amount of data. We quickly ran out of room on our Cloudflare Vectorize indices and moved to the brand-new AWS S3 Vectors platform, syncing to OpenSearch for faster response times and more dynamic filtering. We hit rate limits constantly, so we spread our work over multiple cloud providers and AI models.<p>You can search things like “outdoor grill, less than $1000”, or “sweat-resistant, wireless running earbuds”, or\n&quot;women&#x27;s jeans from Paige that look like [<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gap.com&#x2F;webcontent&#x2F;0020&#x2F;666&#x2F;799&#x2F;cn20666799.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gap.com&#x2F;webcontent&#x2F;0020&#x2F;666&#x2F;799&#x2F;cn20666799.jpg</a>]”. Products come back as JSON with title, brand, images, price, specs, etc.<p>Developers earn commission on sales they drive (averaging 5%). Channel3 takes a cut. We want you to earn way more money from Channel3 than you spend on it. We win when you win.<p>We provide an API, SDK (Typescript and Python), and MCP. We offer 1000 free searches, and charge $7&#x2F;1000 searches after that. You can view expected commissions per-brand on our dashboard.<p>So far, products are US-only (sorry! we will expand). We’re live with millions of products and hundreds of developers.<p>To get started, make a free account at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trychannel3.com</a>, then select which brands you’d like to sell (choose from 50k+ or request your own), generate an API key, and start selling and earning.<p>We’d really appreciate feedback from this community. If you’ve built product search before, what did we miss in the schema? If you’ve tried to add commerce to an app, what blocked you? If you tried to build this yourself, what did you learn? Are there endpoints you wish existed (e.g. price alerts, back-in-stock webhooks, product feed)? For any suggestions, we’re all ears.<p>We’ll be in the thread all day to answer questions, share more technical detail, and hear whatever would make this most useful to you. Comment away!",

      "text": "Hi HN, we’re Ben and Connor, the co-founders of Skope (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useskope.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useskope.com&#x2F;</a>), a billing system that supports outcome-based pricing for software—that is, which charges your customers only when your software actually works. We’re an alternative to Stripe Billing, Orb, and Metronome that natively supports this pricing model, because we believe it’s especially needed for the AI products which are flooding the market and that will continue to be built in the future.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ORxhACQbu64\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ORxhACQbu64</a><p>Prior to working on Skope, we built AI agents that fundraised for nonprofits. We weren’t able to find our stride within the nonprofit world, one reason being that there was no incentive for a nonprofit (with an already small budget) to take on the risk of buying expensive software claiming to replace humans at a high upfront cost, without proving its value first.<p>Instead, they should’ve been able to pay every time our product really worked (in this case by securing a donation or booking a meeting). With this model, we wouldn’t profit with a mediocre product. At the same time, we’d give ourselves more upside if what we were selling truly did its job. All while taking all the risk off of our buyers.<p>Although we really wanted to, there was no easy way to make this happen at scale. It would have had to rely on trust, and depend on every single customer reporting each outcome quickly and accurately. Not the best recipe.<p>So, we decided to build it…which turned out to mean rebuilding billing from scratch. We think a world where people pay for software doing its job is a good one, in which case outcome-based pricing will catch on, but don’t think it’ll happen overnight. There are a ton of wrinkles to figure out still. In the meantime, we’ve also built the rails to support traditional subscriptions and usage&#x2F;credit based models with a focus on making iteration on price really easy.<p>How it works: Our users can easily track customer usage through units (like tokens consumed or emails sent) and set pricing rules such as the price of each unit or a limit for usage per month. These pricing rules are designed to be flexible items that can be modified easily for each customer. Usage is recorded as events uploaded via our API&#x2F;SDK, which are mapped to pricing rules for accurate, immutable billing calculations. Invoices are automatically generated at the end of each billing period based on the events logged during the given period. We are working to develop integrations with LLM observability platforms such as Helicone and Langfuse to make it easy to record customer usage data. Finally, we make it easy to collect payments via Stripe (disconnected from Stripe Billing).<p>For outcomes specifically, we’re working on acting as a middle layer between our customers and their users. The same process for setting prices and units follows as said before, but we’ll have access to both our users’ and their customers’ systems of record to verify that these outcomes actually happened. We built a customer portal so that once outcomes are verified by us, the customer can see and validate them as they happen. If a customer of a company using Skope, wants to dispute a charge, we plan to handle it ourselves through the platform. Transparency and trust are really important between all parties within this model, so we want to do everything possible to encourage that.<p>We really like the outcome-based model because it encourages truly good software and aligns incentives between buyers and sellers. We think that the bar for software will become higher as more companies adopt it and it’ll lead to cool things. At the same time, neither buyers nor sellers can pull a fast one on the other to get a better deal. It’s similar to Google Ads, which introduced pay-per-click pricing to online advertising for the first time. We’re trying to make it possible for the entire software industry to come into the pay-per-performance realm, just like Google did 20 years ago.<p>We’re rolling out at a flat subscription price. Counterintuitively, we don’t think the outcome-based model makes sense for Skope itself. A billing product isn’t one that “may or may not work”, it needs to just work.<p>The way AI companies do business needs new billing infrastructure, and that&#x27;s what we’re working to provide. We have a ton to learn and are eager to hear how others see the future playing out.<p>Please let us know if you have any thoughts on things you’d like to see. Always excited to riff on this and we’d absolutely love your comments!",
