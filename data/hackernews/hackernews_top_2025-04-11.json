      "text": "A large part of our (Real Kinetic&#x27;s) business is helping organizations implement platform engineering, but we&#x27;ve found the existing tooling to be lacking. For IaC, Terraform state becomes a pain because TF treats infrastructure as &quot;one-shot&quot; commands. The Kubernetes controller model provides a nicer approach to managing infrastructure, but the tooling here is also lacking. For configuration management, Helm just doesn&#x27;t really scale with complexity, nor does Kustomize. For resource orchestration, Crossplane is a step in the right direction but still has challenges and limitations.<p>As a result, we ended up building something that&#x27;s sort of a &quot;meta-controller programming language&quot; on top of Kubernetes called Koreo. It provides a solution for configuration management and resource orchestration in Kubernetes by basically letting you program controllers. We&#x27;ve been using Koreo for a while now to build internal developer platform capabilities for our commercial product and our clients, and we recently open sourced it to share it with the community.<p>Koreo has some similarities to configuration languages like KCL, Jsonnet, etc. since it is a means of configuration management (e.g. you can define base configurations, apply overlays, point patches, and so forth). Where it really diverges though is Koreo provides a unified approach to config management <i>and</i> resource orchestration. This means you can start to treat Kubernetes resources as &quot;legos&quot; to build pretty sophisticated workflows. For instance, the output of a resource can be used as the input to another resource. This isn&#x27;t really possible with Helm, even with `lookup` because `lookup` requires the resource to already be in-cluster in order to reference it.<p>This is why we refer to Koreo as a meta-controller programming language because it effectively lets you program and compose Kubernetes controllers into cohesive platforms—either built-in controllers (think Deployment or StatefulSet), off-the-shelf ones such as AWS ACK or GCP&#x27;s Config Connector, or custom operators. It lets you build or combine controllers without actually needing to implement an operator. Through this lens, Koreo is really more akin to Crossplane but without some of the limitations such as Providers and cluster-scoped managed resources.<p>It seems crazy and maybe it is, but I&#x27;ve found working in Koreo to actually be surprisingly fun since it kind of turns Kubernetes primitives into legos you can easily piece together, reuse, and build some pretty cool automated workflows.

But what we truly need in retrieval is relevance, which requires reasoning. When working with professional documents that require domain expertise and multi-step reasoning, vector-based RAG and similarity search often fall short.<p>So we started exploring a more reasoning-driven approach to RAG. Reasoning-based RAG enables LLMs to think and reason their way to the most relevant document sections. Inspired by AlphaGo, we propose to use tree search to perform structured document retrieval.<p>We open-sourced one of the key components: PageIndex. PageIndex is a hierarchical Document Indexing system that builds search trees from long documents (like financial reports, regulatory documents, or textbooks), making them ready for reasoning-based RAG.<p>Some highlights:<p>- Hierarchical Structure: Organizes lengthy PDFs into LLM-friendly trees — like a smart table of contents.<p>- Precise Referencing: Each node includes a summary and exact physical page numbers.<p>- Natural Segmentation: Nodes align with document sections, preserving context — no arbitrary chunking.<p>We&#x27;ve used PageIndex for financial document analysis with reasoning-based RAG and saw significant improvements in retrieval accuracy compared to vector-based systems.<p>Would love any feedback — especially thoughts on reasoning-based RAG, or ideas for where PageIndex could be applied!",

      "text": "One year ago I open-sourced my very first &#x27;real&#x27; project and shared it here. I was a college student in my senior year and desperately looking for a job. At the time of sharing it i couldn&#x27;t even afford a domain and naively let someone buy the one i had my eyes on lol. It&#x27;s been a hell of a year with this blowing up, me moving to another country, and switching 2 jobs.<p>In a year we somehow managed to hit 26k stars, grow a 1000+ person discord community, and support 37 languages. I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful for the community that helped this grow, but now i don&#x27;t know what direction to take this project in.<p>All of this was an accident. But now I feel like I&#x27;m missing out on not using this success. I have been thinking of monetization options, but not sure if I wanna go down that route. I like the idea of it being free and available for everyone but also can&#x27;t help but think of everything that could be done if committed full-time or even had a small team. I keep telling myself(and others) i&#x27;ll do something if i meet a co-founder, but doubt and fear of blowing this up keeps back.<p>How would you proceed?",
