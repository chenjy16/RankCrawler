No one’s been able to translate it, and many think it’s a hoax, a cipher, or a constructed language. I wasn’t trying to decode it — I just wanted to see: does it behave like a structured language?<p>I stripped a handful of common suffix-like endings (aiin, dy, etc.) to isolate what looked like root forms. I know that’s a strong assumption — I call it out directly in the repo — but it helped clarify the clustering. From there, I used SBERT embeddings and KMeans to group similar roots, inferred POS-like roles based on position and frequency, and built a Markov transition matrix to visualize cluster-to-cluster flow.<p>It’s not translation. It’s not decryption. It’s structural modeling — and it revealed some surprisingly consistent syntax across the manuscript, especially when broken out by section (Botanical, Biological, etc.).<p>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brianmg&#x2F;voynich-nlp-analysis\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brianmg&#x2F;voynich-nlp-analysis</a>\nWrite-up: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brig90.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;modeling-the-voynich-manuscript-with?r=3z5dn9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brig90.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;modeling-the-voynich-manuscrip...</a><p>I’m new to the NLP space, so I’m sure there are things I got wrong — but I’d love feedback from people who’ve worked with structured language modeling or weird edge cases like this.",

      "text": "Buckaroo is my open source project. It is a dataframe viewer that has the basic features we expect in a modern table - scroll, search, sort. In addition there are summary stats, and histograms available. Buckaroo support Pandas and Polars dataframes and works on Jupter, Marimo, VSCode and Google Colab notebooks.\nAll of this is extensible. I think of Buckaroo as a framework for building table UIs, and an initial data exploration app built on top of that framework. AG-Grid is used for the core table display and it has been customized with a declarative layer so you don&#x27;t have to pass JS functions around for customizations. On the python side there is a framework for adding summary stats (with a small DAG for dependencies). There is also an entire Low Code UI for point and click selection of common commands (drop column). The lowcode UI also generates a python function that accomplishes the same tasks. This is built on top of JLisp - a small lisp interpreter that reads JSON flavored lisp.<p>Auto Cleaning looks at columns and heuristically suggests common cleaning operations. The operations are added to the lowcode UI where they can be edited. Multiple cleaning strategies can be applied and the best fit retained. Autocleaning without a UI and multiple strategies is very opaque. Since this runs heuristically (not with an LLM), it’s fast and data stays local.<p>I&#x27;m eager to hear feedback from data scientists and other users of dataframes&#x2F;notebooks.",

Short demo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;209c7042-6d54-4fce-92a7-ddf8519156c6\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user-attachments&#x2F;assets&#x2F;209c7042-6d54-4fc...</a><p>Inspired by projects like Browser Use and Playwright MCP, its main advantage is the browser extension form factor which makes it more convenient for day to day use, especially for less technical users. Its also a bit less cumbersome to use on websites that require you to be logged in, as it attaches to the same browser instance you use (on privacy: the only data that leaves your browser is the communication with the LLM - there is no tracking or data collection of any sort).<p>Some of its core features are as follows:<p>- a memory feature which allows users to memorize common and useful pathways, making the next repetition of those tasks faster and cheaper<p>- real-time token counting and cost tracking (inspired by Cline)<p>- an approval flow for critical tasks such as posting content or making payments (also inspired by Cline)<p>- tab management allowing the agent to execute tasks across multiple tabs<p>- a range of browser tools for navigation, tab management, interactions, etc, which are broadly in line with Playwright MCP<p>I&#x27;m actively developing BrowserBee and would love to hear any thoughts, comments, or feedback.<p>Feel free to reach out via email: parsa.ghaffari [at] gmail [dot] com<p>-Parsa",

It&#x27;s 100% free, works in your browser on mobile and desktop, and requires no sign-up or installation.<p>I built it to solve a personal problem. I started playing badminton regularly in 2016 and quickly learned that players often ask stringers to string rackets at specific tensions (like 22 or 26 lbs). But after a few stringing jobs, I began to feel like the tension was inconsistent. Other players told me they just tap the strings and go by ear  where &quot;sharper sound meant higher tension.&quot;<p>One day while tuning my guitar, I could see exact sound frequencies on my tuner app. That’s when it clicked. It should be possible to build a tuner for badminton strings as well!<p>I searched online and found some tension-frequency data shared by professional stringers, but it wasn’t clean or comprehensive. So I visited 5 or 6 local stringers, gave them a frequency measuring app, and asked them to record racket head size, string thickness, tension, and sound frequency for each job. Some asked for a small payment, but most helped for free. Within a week, I had over 200 solid data points.<p>I trained a simple regression model using that data and validated it with newly strung rackets. It turned out to be surprisingly accurate. I shared it with friends and fellow players, and it started to spread in badminton forums.<p>There was another app that launched a few months later with big celebrity endorsements, but it was less accurate, harder to use, and required in-app purchases. Mine wasn&#x27;t built to compete, but it ended up being more useful.<p>I originally released it as a mobile app, but constant changes in Google Play policies kept taking it down. So I rebuilt it as a simple browser-based tool.<p>Would love feedback, suggestions for improvements, or ideas on how to sustain it without cluttering it with ads or paywalls.<p>Let me know what you think.",

Today we announced a free-to-use web app that takes any form of workflow diagram (UML, BPMN, scribble in your favorite drawing tool or even on paper) and generates code that runs in any IDE and that can be deployed to Kubernetes and other container based systems, based on Dapr&#x27;s durable execution workflow engine. This essentially allows you to run durable workflows in minutes and leaves out the guesswork for how to structure, code and optimize a code-first workflow app. I&#x27;m happy for you to give this a try and provide feedback!",

      "text": "Hello HN! We’re Tanya, Sacha, Jules and Nate from Tinfoil: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinfoil.sh\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinfoil.sh</a>. We host models and AI workloads on the cloud while guaranteeing zero data access and retention. This lets us run open-source LLMs like Llama, or Deepseek R1 on cloud GPUs without you having to trust us—or any cloud provider—with private data.<p>Since AI performs better the more context you give it, we think solving AI privacy will unlock more valuable AI applications, just how TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish knowing that your credit card info wouldn&#x27;t be stolen by someone sniffing internet packets.<p>We come from backgrounds in cryptography, security, and infrastructure. Jules did his PhD in trusted hardware and confidential computing at MIT, and worked with NVIDIA and Microsoft Research on the same, Sacha did his PhD in privacy-preserving cryptography at MIT, Nate worked on privacy tech like Tor, and I (Tanya) was on Cloudflare&#x27;s cryptography team. We were unsatisfied with band-aid techniques like PII redaction (which is actually undesirable in some cases like AI personal assistants) or “pinky promise” security through legal contracts like DPAs. We wanted a real solution that replaced trust with provable security.<p>Running models locally or on-prem is an option, but can be expensive and inconvenient. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is not practical for LLM inference for the foreseeable future. The next best option is using secure enclaves: a secure environment on the chip that no other software running on the host machine can access. This lets us perform LLM inference in the cloud while being able to prove that no one, not even Tinfoil or the cloud provider, can access the data. And because these security mechanisms are implemented in hardware, there is minimal performance overhead.<p>Even though we (Tinfoil) control the host machine, we do not have any visibility into the data processed inside of the enclave. At a high level, a secure enclave is a set of cores that are reserved, isolated, and locked down to create a sectioned off area. Everything that comes out of the enclave is encrypted: memory and network traffic, but also peripheral (PCIe) traffic to other devices such as the GPU. These encryptions are performed using secret keys that are generated inside the enclave during setup, which never leave its boundaries. Additionally, a “hardware root of trust” baked into the chip lets clients check security claims and verify that all security mechanisms are in place.<p>Up until recently, secure enclaves were only available on CPUs. But NVIDIA confidential computing recently added these hardware-based capabilities to their latest GPUs, making it possible to run GPU-based workloads in a secure enclave.<p>Here’s how it works in a nutshell:<p>1. We publish the code that should run inside the secure enclave to Github, as well as a hash of the compiled binary to a transparency log called Sigstore<p>2. Before sending data to the enclave, the client fetches a signed document from the enclave which includes a hash of the running code signed by the CPU manufacturer. It then verifies the signature with the hardware manufacturer to prove the hardware is genuine. Then the client fetches a hash of the source code from a transparency log (Sigstore) and checks that the hash equals the one we got from the enclave. This lets the client get verifiable proof that the enclave is running the exact code we claim.<p>3. With the assurance that the enclave environment is what we expect, the client sends its data to the enclave, which travels encrypted (TLS) and is only decrypted inside the enclave.<p>4. Processing happens entirely within this protected environment. Even an attacker that controls the host machine can’t access this data.\nWe believe making end-to-end verifiability a “first class citizen” is key. Secure enclaves have traditionally been used to remove trust from the cloud provider, not necessarily from the application provider. This is evidenced by confidential VM technologies such as Azure Confidential VM allowing ssh access by the host into the confidential VM. Our goal is to provably remove trust both from ourselves, aka the application provider, as well as the cloud provider.<p>We encourage you to be skeptical of our privacy claims. Verifiability is our answer. It’s not just us saying it’s private; the hardware and cryptography let you check. Here’s a guide that walks you through the verification process: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tinfoil.sh&#x2F;verification&#x2F;attestation-architecture\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tinfoil.sh&#x2F;verification&#x2F;attestation-architectur...</a>.<p>People are using us for analyzing sensitive docs, building copilots for proprietary code, and processing user data in agentic AI applications without the privacy risks that previously blocked cloud AI adoption.<p>We’re excited to share Tinfoil with HN!<p>* Try the chat (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinfoil.sh&#x2F;chat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinfoil.sh&#x2F;chat</a>): It verifies attestation with an in-browser check. Free, limited messages, $20&#x2F;month for unlimited messages and additional models<p>* Use the API (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinfoil.sh&#x2F;inference\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinfoil.sh&#x2F;inference</a>): OpenAI API compatible interface. $2 &#x2F; 1M tokens<p>* Take your existing Docker image and make it end to end confidential by deploying on Tinfoil. Here&#x27;s a demo of how you could use Tinfoil to run a deepfake detection service that could run securely on people&#x27;s private videos: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_8hLmqoutyk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_8hLmqoutyk</a>.
