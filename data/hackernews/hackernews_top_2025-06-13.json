I&#x27;d like to submit for your consideration Tritium (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tritium.legal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tritium.legal</a>). Tritium aims to bring the power of the integrated development environment (IDE) to corporate lawyers.<p>My name is Drew Miller, and I&#x27;m lawyer admitted to the New York bar. I have spent the last 13 years in and out of corporate transactional practice, while building side projects in various languages using vanilla Vim. One day at work, I was asked to implement a legal technology product at my firm. Of course the only product available for editing and running programs in a locked-down environment was VS Code and its friends like Puppeteer from Microsoft.<p>I was really blown away at all of the capabilities of go-to definition and out-of-the box syntax highlighting as well as the debugger integration. I made the switch to a full IDE for my side projects immediately. And it hit me: why don&#x27;t we have this exact same tool in corporate law?<p>Corporate lawyers spent hours upon hours fumbling between various applications and instances of Word and Adobe. There are sub-par differencing products that make `patch` look like the future. They do this while charging you ridiculous rates.<p>I left my practice a few months later to build Tritium. Tritium aims to be the lawyer&#x27;s VS Code: an all-in-one drafting cockpit that treats a deal&#x27;s entire document suite as a single, searchable, AI-enhanced workspace while remaining fast, local, and secure.<p>Tritium is implemented in pure Rust. It is cross-platform and I&#x27;m excited for the prospect of lawyers running Linux as their daily driver. It leverages a modified version of the super fast egui.rs immediate-mode GUI library. The windows build includes a Rust COM implementation which was probably one of the more technical challenges other than laying out and rendering the text.<p>Download a copy at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tritium.legal&#x2F;download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tritium.legal&#x2F;download</a> or try out a web-only WASM preview here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tritium.legal&#x2F;preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tritium.legal&#x2F;preview</a><p>Let me know your thoughts! Your criticisms are the most important. Thank you for the time.",

      "text": "I recently dug my Nintendo GameCube out of storage to revisit the first Animal Crossing game. Things were mostly as I remembered, but the game&#x27;s heavy reliance on a clunky on-screen keyboard quickly wore my patience thin.<p>Unwilling to accept this subpar experience, I did what any rational person would do and ordered a rare, Japan-exclusive, keyboard&#x2F;controller hybrid on eBay, then used a Raspberry Pi Pico to 1. listen for keypresses and 2. send simulated controller events to the GameCube, automating typing in Animal Crossing at a Tool-Assisted Speedrun level.<p>Of course, this oddball controller&#x27;s keycaps didn&#x27;t map perfectly to Animal Crossing&#x27;s in-game character set, so I watched a 10 hour FreeCAD tutorial at 2x speed, then modeled the 7 keycap profiles to create 81 custom, 3D printed keycaps, taking care to include even the most esoteric Greek and Old English characters that Nintendo chose to include in the game.<p>And then, having solved my original problem, I decided to sniff out some new ones.\nI used my homemade TAS device to automate the entry of customizable &quot;Town Tune&quot; melodies, took advantage of a cracked encryption algorithm to give on-demand access to (almost) every item in the game, and, in a Club-Mate-fueled haze, whipped up a Python script to convert arbitrary images to the game&#x27;s 32x32 pixel custom design format.<p>Even at superhuman speed, those 1024 pixels took about 3 minutes to input, but that didn&#x27;t stop me from extending the concept to video - playing Rick Astley&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, Bad Apple!, Shrek, and even a short gameplay video of DOOM very, veryyyy slowly (about 7.5 hours to render 30 seconds of footage at 5fps).<p>Then, realizing that DOOM at 0.0056fps probably wouldn&#x27;t be the most &quot;playable&quot; thing in the world, I set out to get some kind of video game running within Animal Crossing, and ultimately landed on Snake.<p>Since it only needs to update 1 pixel for every frame of animation, I was able to get Snake running at around 1ish* frames per second (for technical reasons, it runs at a variable framerate).\nMaybe not the most primo experience the modern gaming world has to offer, but without a doubt, <i>technically</i> a video game. It even has its own, in-memory high score ranking (so far I&#x27;m undefeated).<p>The code and design files are distributed for free on GitHub[0], and a build&#x2F;demonstration video[1] is out now on Youtube.<p>[0] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hunterirving&#x2F;pico-crossing\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hunterirving&#x2F;pico-crossing</a><p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yw8Alf_lolA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yw8Alf_lolA</a><p>It started as a &quot;quick, simple project&quot;, then quickly ballooned into 7 or 8 &quot;quick, simple projects&quot;, but I had a ton of fun putting it all together.

After plenty of supplier haggling, the whole kit costs less than the twelve servos alone. I’ll release the updated mechanical design under an MIT license by June 30.<p>On the software side, I&#x27;ll also release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30 that exposes the local robot policy as tools for agentic LLMs (Opus 4, o3, etc.) to use in long-horizon tasks. Here&#x27;s how it works: You can teach the robot new skills through teleoperation. During inference, you simply talk to the agentic LLM using natural language instructions. The LLM then calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically decomposing your high-level requests into executable robot commands.<p>Thanks to the LeRobot community for making such an amazing robot accessible. If you’ve contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon as a small thank-you.<p>I’d love your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, cleaning up the codebase, and writing docs, I’m considering: a force-controlled gripper, a parallel-jaw gripper, an extra wrist DOF (matching the new Trossen and ARX arms), full force feedback on the leader arm (though that may triple the price), a more affordable version with lower resolution each joint, and a longer-reach variant. Which of these—or something else—would be most useful to you?<p>You can order it here if you want: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-l...</a>.

We build AI agents that handle repetitive administrative tasks in healthcare clinics like filling out intake forms, prepping charts, or managing referrals.<p>We were early employees at Forward, which provided primary care across the US. To scale this, we relied on thousands of remote contractors to do repetitive administrative work like reconciling patient records, and scheduling follow-ups based on care plans. It was a huge bottleneck—expensive, error-prone, and always pulling attention away from clinical care. Our software solutions were always too brittle, never managing to handle the variance of clinical data we oversaw.<p>AI, when applied well, is capable of performing a lot of the tasks we manually did. So we decided to take another crack at the problem by building today what we would have liked to have back then, and to help clinics use it.<p>Clinics send us their SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures—for example, “prep a patient chart from these records before a visit”), and we turn them into AI agents that do the work. These agents act like remote contractors: they log into EHRs, navigate internal tools, and do the work in the background. Unlike classical RPA, we build in verification and deterministic checks, so customers can confirm it was done right. \nUnlike low-code tools, there’s nothing new to learn. Customers don’t have to touch a UI or maintain logic. They just hand us the task, and we do it. Clinicians don’t want more screens! They erode attention and cause weird bottlenecks in operations because someone has to drive them. Our product is built to address this.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g</a>. We’re not self-serve yet, but we deploy with customers in days after onboarding them. We’re working on speeding that up.<p>One of our early customers is a fast-growing obesity medicine group. Their MAs were spending 15 to 20 minutes per patient just entering intake form data into the EHR. That one task was taking up 30% of their MA time. We took it over in a week. It’s now fully automated, and they’ve cleared the backlog and sped up visits.<p>A few technical problems are specifically relevant to building healthcare agents:<p>- Unreliable interfaces: many EHRs and clinic tools don’t follow modern web standards, making automation brittle. We’ve forked browser-use to solve some of these challenges. We’re working on analogous infrastructure to let agents operate on desktops and across a wide range of APIs.<p>- Verification: in healthcare, tasks need to be provably correct. We embed deterministic checks into each workflow so agents can confirm the task was completed as expected and the output is accurate.<p>- Workflow generation: clinic SOPs are written in natural language and vary widely, yet still describe the actual process that works for clinics.<p>We charge per task, based on complexity. We’re HIPAA compliant, audit-logged, and operate in a zero-retention environment unless auditing requires otherwise.<p>A meaningful part is building trust in a high-stakes environment like healthcare. Part of that is making the product reliable. But another educational part is learning how to introduce a new concept like “agents” to clinics. We’re working on the right ways to describe them, to onboard them, to measure them. Endearingly, one of our customers’ agents is named “Robert Ott”, and they refer to him by name in their weekly updates like he’s a member of the team :) We’re learning a lot and have a long way to go.<p>We’d love to meet other folks who 1. work in medical groups or health systems and want to offload repetitive work, and 2. are building in this space and want to trade notes. We’re happy to share everything we’ve learned so far.<p>And this is a big space, with a lot of learnings from personal stories, from clinicians, technologists, administrators, and more. What do you make of it? We’d love to hear from you.",
