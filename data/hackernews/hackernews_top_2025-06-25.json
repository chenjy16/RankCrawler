Worse, dozens of malicious extensions have already made it into the marketplace, silently compromising devices.<p>I am a security researcher and student developer who ran into this problem myself. To help tackle this, I built a 100% free tool (no login required) that scans VSCode (and Cursor&#x2F;Windsurf) extensions for:<p>- Hidden malware and obfuscated code<p>- Dangerous permissions and API misuse<p>- Vulnerable dependencies and suspicious network connections<p>Users have already found hundreds of vulnerabilities in extensions. VSCan generates a clean, developer-friendly security report to help you  understand what you&#x27;re installing.<p>Try it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vscan.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vscan.dev</a><p>I have also developed custom sandboxing security architecture to restrict extensions from malicious activity during runtime. There is no existing technology that does this, so if you would be interested in trying it out or learning more, please reach out!<p>I would greatly appreciate any feedback and thanks for your help!<p>_______________________________________________________________________________<p>Here are some numbers as to what I have detected from a sample of 1077 extensions that are available on the Marketplace:<p>- 3 extensions are marked as malicious by VirusTotal\n- 7 extensions use malicious network connections (verified by VirusTotal)\n- 33 extensions have dependencies with critical vulnerabilities\n- 39 extensions have sensitive information (I have seen api keys, usernames, passwords, etc.)\n- 204 extension have poor development practices as marked by OSSF\n- 71 extensions have very high permissions (while not bad can be indicator of potential malicious activity)<p>As an example here is the link to an extension analysis with malicious network endpoints:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vscan.dev&#x2F;?analysisId=9e6c1849-3973-402b-a4ff-3b4023508fb8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vscan.dev&#x2F;?analysisId=9e6c1849-3973-402b-a4ff-3b4023...</a>",

Autumn is an open source layer over Stripe that decouples pricing and billing logic from your application. We let you efficiently manage pricing plans, feature permissions, and payments, regardless of the pricing model being used. Itâ€™s a bit like if Supabase and Stripe had a baby.<p>Typically, you have to write code to handle checkouts, upgrades&#x2F;downgrades, failed payments, then receive webhooks to provision features, reset usage limits etc. We abstract this into one function call for all payments flows (checkouts, upgrades, downgrades etc), one function to record usage (so we can track usage limits), and a customer state React hook you can access from your frontend (to handle paywalls, display usage data etc).<p>Hereâ€™s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SFARthC7JXc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SFARthC7JXc</a><p>Stripeâ€™s great! But there are 2 main reasons people use Autumn over a direct Stripe setup:<p>(1) Billing infra can get complex. After payments, thereâ€™s still handling webhooks, permission management, metering, usage resets, and connecting them all to upgrade, downgrade, cancellation and failed payments states.<p>(2) Growing companies iterate on pricing often: raising prices, experimenting with credits or charging for new features, etc. We save you from having to handle usage-based limits (super common in pricing today), rebuilding in-app flows, DB migrations, internal dashboards for custom pricing, and grandfathering users on different pricing.<p>Ripping out billing flows etc, really sucks. With Autumn, you just make pricing changes in our UI and it all auto-updates. We have a shadcn&#x2F;ui component library that helps with this.<p>Because we support a lot of different pricing models (subscriptions, usage, credits, seat based etc), we have to handle a lot of different scenarios and cases under the hood. We try to keep setup simple while maintaining flexibility of a native integration. Hereâ€™s a little snippet of the architecture of our main endpoint: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;useautumn.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;attach\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;useautumn.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;attach</a><p>Currently, the users who get the most value out of us are founders that need to move fast and keep things flexible, but also new&#x2F;non-technical devs that are more AI native.<p>You can clone the project and explore the repo, or try it out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;useautumn.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;useautumn.com&#x2F;</a>, where itâ€™s free for builders. Our repo is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;useautumn&#x2F;autumn\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;useautumn&#x2F;autumn</a>, docs are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.useautumn.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.useautumn.com&#x2F;</a> and demo at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SFARthC7JXc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SFARthC7JXc</a><p>Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback and how we could make it better!",

Reducto turns unstructured documents (e.g., PDFs, scans, spreadsheets) into structured data. This data can then be used for retrieval, passed into LLMs, or used elsewhere downstream.<p>We started Reducto when we realized that so many of todayâ€™s AI applications require good quality data. Everyone knows that good inputs lead to better outputs, but 80% of the worldâ€™s data is still trapped inside of things like messy PDFs and spreadsheets. Raunak and I launched a really early MVP of parsing and extracting from unstructured documents, and were lucky to have a lot of interest from technical teams when they realized that the accuracy was something they hadnâ€™t seen before.<p>We started by just releasing an API for engineers to build with, but over time we realized that an accurate API was only part of the puzzle. Our customers wanted to be able to easily set up multi step pipelines, evaluate and iterate on performance within their use case, and work with non-engineering teammates that were also involved in the real world document processing flow.<p>Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re launching Reducto Studio, a web platform that sits on top of our APIs for users to build and iterate on end-to-end document pipelines.<p>With Studio, you can:<p>- Drop an entire file set and get per-field and per-document accuracy scores against your eval data.<p>- Auto-generate and continuously optimize extraction schemas to hit production-grade quality fast.<p>- Save every run, iterate on parse&#x2F;extract configs, and compare results side-by-side.<p>You can see some examples here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.reducto.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studio.reducto.ai</a>) or you can watch this walkthrough: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b243551741c642c6a594c00353fcecb3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b243551741c642c6a594c00353fcecb3</a>.<p>If youâ€™d like to upload your own document you can log in and do so as well - we donâ€™t make you book a demo or put a payment down to try it.<p>Thanks for reading and checking it out! This is only the first step for Studio, so weâ€™d love feedback on anything: UX rough edges (we know theyâ€™re there!), features that would make evaluations better for you, hard documents youâ€™ve had trouble with, or anything else about wrangling with unstructured data.",
