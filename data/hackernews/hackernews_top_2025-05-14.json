      "text": "Hey HN, we want to share HelixDB (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;</a>), a project a college friend and I are working on. It’s a new database that natively intertwines graph and vector types, without sacrificing performance. It’s written in Rust and our initial focus is on supporting RAG. Here’s a video runthrough: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screen.studio&#x2F;share&#x2F;szgQu3yq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screen.studio&#x2F;share&#x2F;szgQu3yq</a>.<p>Why a hybrid? Vector databases are useful for similarity queries, while graph databases are useful for relationship queries. Each stores data in a way that’s best for its main type of query (e.g. key-value stores vs. node-and-edge tables). However, many AI-driven applications need <i>both</i> similarity and relationship queries. For example, you might use vector-based semantic search to retrieve relevant legal documents, and then use graph traversal to identify relationships between cases.<p>Developers of such apps have the quandary of needing to build on top of two different databases—a vector one and a graph one—plus you have to link them together and sync the data. Even then, your two databases aren&#x27;t designed to work together—for example, there’s no native way to perform joins or queries that span both systems. You’ll need to handle that logic at the application level.<p>Helix started when we realized that there are ways to integrate vector and graph data that are both fast and suitable for AI applications, especially RAG-based ones. See this cool research paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;2408.04948v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;2408.04948v1</a>. After reading that and some other papers on graph and hybrid RAG, we decided to build a hybrid DB. Our aim was to make something better to use from a developer standpoint, while also making it fast as hell.<p>After a few months of working on this as a side project, our benchmarking shows that we are on par with Pinecone and Qdrant for vectors, and our graph is up to three orders of magnitude faster than Neo4j.<p>Problems where a hybrid approach works particularly well include:<p>- Indexing codebases: you can vectorize code-snippets within a function (connected by edges) based on context and then create an AST (in a graph) from function calls, imports, dependencies, etc. Agents can look up code by similarity or keyword and then traverse the AST to get only the relevant code, which reduces hallucinations and prevents the LLM from guessing object shapes or variable&#x2F;function names.<p>- Molecule discovery: Model biological interactions (e.g., proteins → genes → diseases) using graph types and then embed molecule structures to find similar compounds or case studies.<p>- Enterprise knowledge management: you can represent organisational structure, projects, and people (e.g., employee → team → project) in graph form, then index internal documents, emails, or notes as vectors for semantic search and link them directly employees&#x2F;teams&#x2F;projects in the graph.<p>I naively assumed when learning about databases for the first time that queries would be compiled and executed like functions in traditional programming. Turns out I was wrong, but this creates unnecessary latency by sending extra data (the whole written query), compiling it at run time, and then executing it. With Helix, you write the queries in our query language (HelixQL), which is then transpiled into Rust code and built directly into the database server, where you can call a generated API endpoint.<p>Many people have a thing against “yet another query language” (doubtless for good reason!) but we went ahead and did it anyway, because we think it makes working with our database so much easier that it’s worth a bit of a learning curve. HelixQL takes from other query languages such as Gremlin, Cypher and SQL with some extra ideas added in. It is declarative while the traversals themselves are functional. This allows complete control over the traversal flow while also having a cleaner syntax. HelixQL returns JSON to make things easy for clients. Also, it uses a schema, so the queries are type-checked.<p>We took a crude approach to building the original graph engine as a way to get an MVP out, so we are now working on improving the graph engine by making traversals massively parallel and pipelined. This means data is only ever decoded from disk when it is needed, and parts of reads are all processed in parallel.<p>If you’d like to try it out in a simple RAG demo, you can follow this guide and run our Jupyter notebook: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples&#x2F;rag_demo\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples&#x2F;rag_d...</a><p>Many thanks!

It helps you learn better through active practice and personalized feedback.<p>We use LLMs to automatically generate quizzes, practice questions, and real-time feedback from any educational video or resource—turning passive watching into active learning. Here’s a short demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;alO7FaorHOY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;alO7FaorHOY</a>.<p>Improving education has always been tricky. Bloom’s 2-sigma problem (showing that a high-quality personal tutor is far more effective than conventional methods) has persisted, even as technology has advanced.<p>We met at MIT as CS majors and have always been passionate about education. Over the years, we’ve become teachers and experts in subjects like chess, algorithms, math, languages, and ninja warrior. A common theme was that we both heavily relied on YouTube to learn.<p>YouTube has incredible content for learning pretty much anything, but it’s buried in a lot of distractions. Also, passively watching videos is far less effective than taking notes, asking questions, and doing practice problems, which is what we aim to do with Miyagi Labs.<p>Our solution is essentially a multi-step function that takes in a YouTube playlist (or list of any resources) and outputs an entire course with summaries, questions, answers, and more. The pipeline is roughly: video&#x2F;resource —&gt; transcript&#x2F;text —&gt; chunks —&gt; summary and question —&gt; answers to questions, with some other features along the way.<p>We mostly use prompting and different models at each step to make the course as useful as possible. Certain topics require more practice problems vs. comprehension, and we’d use reasoning models for highly technical subjects.<p>We launched about three months ago and currently have 400+ courses and partnerships with some businesses and awesome creators. Some of our popular courses include 3Blue1Brown’s linear algebra course, a botany course on plants and ecology, and YC’s How to Start a Startup series.<p>Our product resembles classical MOOC-style course platforms in terms of UI, but is more interactive. It’s really easy to ask a question or receive custom feedback compared to a static course on Coursera. It’s also comparable to AI tutor sites, but we try to build more of a community and require less activation energy as a learner. We’re basically betting that AI can hugely improve education, but that students still want to learn from their favorite creators and want baseline shared resources for standard topics that are then augmented with personalized features.<p>You can try it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miyagilabs.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miyagilabs.ai</a> (no login required for most courses—but if you sign up you can also create your own course).<p>We’d love your feedback on what kinds of videos&#x2F;resources you’d like to learn from, what’s missing from current learning tools, and if you know any creators or educators who would like to collaborate. Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!",

      "text": "Hey HN! I&#x27;m Win, founder of ParaQuery (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paraquery.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paraquery.com</a>), a fully-managed, GPU-accelerated Spark + SQL solution. We deliver BigQuery&#x27;s ease of use (or easier) while being significantly more cost-efficient and performant.<p>Here&#x27;s a short demo video demonstrating ParaQuery (vs. BigQuery) on a simple ETL job: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uu379YnccGU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uu379YnccGU</a><p>It&#x27;s well known that GPUs are very good for many SQL and dataframe tasks, at least by researchers and GPU companies like NVIDIA. So much so that, in 2018, NVIDIA launched the RAPIDS program and the Spark-RAPIDS plugin (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;spark-rapids\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;spark-rapids</a>). I actually found out because, at the time, I was trying to craft a CUDA-based lambda calculus interpreter…one of several ideas I didn&#x27;t manage to implement, haha.<p>There seems to be a perception among at least some engineers that GPUs are only good for AI, graphics, and maybe image processing (maybe! someone actually told me they thought GPUs are bad for image processing!) Traditional data processing doesn’t come to mind. But actually GPUs are good for this as well!<p>At a high level, big data processing is a high-throughput, massively parallel workload. GPUs are a type of hardware specialized for this, are highly programmable, and (now) happen to be highly available on the cloud! Even better, GPU <i>memory</i> is tuned for bandwidth over raw latency, which only improves their throughput capabilities compared to a CPU. And by just playing with cloud cost calculators for a couple of minutes, it&#x27;s clear that GPUs are cost-effective even on the major clouds.<p>To be honest, I thought using GPUs for SQL processing would have taken off by now, but it hasn&#x27;t. So, just over a year ago, I started working on actually deploying a cloud-based data platform powered by GPUs (i.e. Spark-RAPIDS), spurred by a friend-of-a-friend(-of-a-friend) who happened to have BigQuery cost concerns at his startup. After getting a proof of concept done and a letter of intent... well, nothing happened! Even after over half a year. But then, something magical did happen: their cloud credits ran out!<p>And now, they&#x27;re saving over 60% off of their BigQuery bill by using ParaQuery, while also being 2x faster -- with zero data migration needed (courtesy of Spark&#x27;s GCS connector). By the way, I&#x27;m not sure about other people&#x27;s experiences but... we&#x27;re pretty far from being IO-bound (to the surprise of many engineers I&#x27;ve spoken to).<p>I think that the future of high-throughput compute is computing on high-throughput hardware. If you think so too, or you have scaling data challenges, you can sign up here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paraquery.com&#x2F;waitlist\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paraquery.com&#x2F;waitlist</a>. Sorry for the waitlist, but we&#x27;re not ready for a self-serve experience just yet—it would front-load significant engineering and hardware cost. But we’ll get there, so stay tuned!<p>Thanks for reading! What have your experiences been with huge ETL &#x2F; processing loads? Was cost or performance an issue? And what do you think about GPU acceleration (GPGPU)? Did you think GPUs were simply expensive? Would love to just talk about tech here!",

      "text": "Hey HN, we&#x27;re Lennert and Rauf. We’re building Airweave (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;airweave-ai&#x2F;airweave\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;airweave-ai&#x2F;airweave</a>), an open-source tool that lets agents search and retrieve data from any app or database. Here’s a general intro: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EFI-7SYGQ48\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EFI-7SYGQ48</a>, and here’s a longer one that shows more real-world use cases, examples of how Airweave is used by Cursor (0:33) and Claude desktop (2:04), etc.: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;p2dl-39HwQo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;p2dl-39HwQo</a><p>A couple of months ago we were building agents that interacted with different apps and were frustrated when they struggled to handle vague natural language requests like &quot;resolve that one Linear issue about missing auth configs&quot;, &quot;if you get an email from an unsatisfied customer, reimburse their payment in Stripe&quot;, or &quot;what were the returns for Q1 based on the financials sheet in gdrive?&quot;, only to have the agent inefficiently chain together loads of function calls to find the data or not find it at all and hallucinate.<p>We also noticed that despite the rise of MCP creating more desire for agents to interact with external resources, the majority of agent dev tooling focused on function calling and actions instead of search. We were annoyed by the lack of tooling that enabled agents to semantically search workspace or database contents, so we started building Airweave first as an internal solution. Then we decided to open-source it and pursue it full time after we got positive reactions from coworkers and other agent builders.<p>Airweave connects to productivity tools, databases, or document stores via their APIs and transforms their contents into searchable knowledge bases, accessible through a standardized interface for the agent. The search interface is exposed via REST or MCP. When using MCP, Airweave essentially builds a semantically searchable MCP server on top of the resource. The platform handles the entire data pipeline from connection and extraction to chunking, embedding, and serving. To ensure knowledge is current, it has automated sync capabilities, with configurable schedules and change detection through content hashing.<p>We built it with support for white-labeled multi-tenancy to provide OAuth2-based integration across multiple user accounts while maintaining privacy and security boundaries. We&#x27;re also actively working on permission-awareness (i.e., RBAC on the data) for the platform.<p>So happy to share learnings and get insights from your experiences. looking forward to comments!",
