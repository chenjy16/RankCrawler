As engineers, we did not like that. MCP seemed like something you wanted to use to build products and applications yourself, not something to hide behind a closed source application.<p>So we approached the SDK but were pretty dissatisfied with the developer experience (double async loops, lots of boilerplate). We decided to write mcp-use to make our lives easier.<p>mcp-use lets you connect any LLM to any MCP server in just 6 lines of code. We provide a high level abstraction over the official MCP SDK that makes your life easier and supports all the functionalities of the protocol.<p>Demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nL_B6LZAsp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nL_B6LZAsp4</a>.<p>The key abstractions we provide are called MCPClient and MCPAgent.<p>MCPClient takes in a set of server configurations, automatically detects the transport type and creates a background task which handles the stream from&#x2F;to the server.<p>MCPAgent is a combination of the MCPClient, an LLM, and a custom system prompt. It consumes the MCP client by transforming the tools, resources and prompts into model agnostic tools that can be called by the LLM.<p>The library also contains some cool utilities:<p>- secure sandboxed execution of MCP servers (we know the protocol doesn&#x27;t shine for security)<p>- meta-tools that allow the agent to search over available servers and tools (to avoid context flooding) and connect dynamically to the server it needs (you could create the omnipotent agent with this).<p>Some cool things we did with this:\n- write an agent that can use a browser and create&#x2F;read linear tickets updated with latest information on the internet<p>- write an agent that has access to the metrics of our company to automatically create weekly reports.<p>- I connected an agent to an IKEA curtain I hacked an MCP on to adapt the lighting of my room from images of the lighting situation.<p>- recreated am open source claude code like CLI, with full MCP capability but with custom models and BYOK (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcp-use&#x2F;mcp-use-cli\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcp-use&#x2F;mcp-use-cli</a>).<p>We recently crossed 100,000 download and we are used by many organizations, including NASA!<p>We’d love to hear what you think of it, most importantly how we can improve it! We are happy to answer any questions and look forward to your comments.",

We originally launched on HN 9 months ago with code search (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41711032\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41711032</a>), and we’re excited to share our newest feature: Ask Sourcebot.<p>Ask Sourcebot is an agentic search tool that lets you ask complex questions about your entire codebase in natural language, and returns a structured response with inline citations back to your code. Some types of questions you might ask:<p>- “How does authentication work in this codebase? What library is being used?  What providers can a user log in with?” (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.sourcebot.dev&#x2F;~&#x2F;chat&#x2F;cmdpjkrbw000bnn7s8of2dm11\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.sourcebot.dev&#x2F;~&#x2F;chat&#x2F;cmdpjkrbw000bnn7s8of2dm11</a>)<p>- “When should I use channels vs. mutexes in go?

We believe that, more than ever, the main bottleneck development teams face is not writing code, it’s acquiring the necessary context to make quality changes that are cohesive within the wider codebase. This is true regardless if the author is a human or an LLM.<p>- As opposed to being in your IDE or terminal, Sourcebot is a web app. This allows us to play to the strengths of the web: rich UX and ubiquitous access. We put a ton of work into taking the best parts of IDEs (code navigation, file explorer, syntax highlighting) and packaging them with a custom UX (rich Markdown rendering, inline citations, @ mentions) that is easily shareable between team members.<p>- Sourcebot can maintain an up-to date index of thousands of repos hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gerrit, and other hosts. This allows you to ask questions about repositories without checking them out locally. This is especially helpful when ramping up on unfamiliar parts of the codebase or working with systems that are typically spread across multiple repositories, e.g., micro services.<p>- You can BYOK (Bring Your Own API Key) to any supported reasoning model. We currently support 11 different model providers (like Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex), and plan to add more.<p>- Sourcebot is self-hosted, fair source, and free to use.<p>Under the hood, we expose our existing regular expression search, code navigation, and file reading APIs to a LLM as tool calls. We instruct the LLM via a system prompt to gather the necessary context via these tools to sufficiently answer the users question, and then to provide a concise, structured response. This includes inline citations, which are just structured data that the LLM can embed into it’s response and can then be identified on the client and rendered appropriately. We built this on some amazing libraries like the Vercel AI SDK v5, CodeMirror, react-markdown, and Slate.js, among others.<p>This architecture is intentionally simple. We decided not to introduce any additional techniques like vector embeddings, multi-agent graphs, etc. since we wanted to push the limits of what we could do with what we had on hand. We plan on revisiting our approach as we get user feedback on what works (and what doesn’t).<p>We are really excited about pushing the envelope of code understanding. Give it a try: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sourcebot-dev&#x2F;sourcebot\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sourcebot-dev&#x2F;sourcebot</a>. Cheers!",

      "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m JJ, Co-Founder of Gecko Security (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gecko.security\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gecko.security</a>). We&#x27;re building a new kind of static analysis tool that uses LLMs to find complex business logic and multi-step vulnerabilities that current scanners miss. We’ve used it to find 30+ CVEs in projects like Ollama, Gradio, and Ragflow (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gecko.security&#x2F;research\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gecko.security&#x2F;research</a>). You can try it yourself on any OSS repo at (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.gecko.security\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.gecko.security</a>).<p>Anyone who’s used SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools knows the issues of high false positives while missing entire classes of vulnerabilities like AuthN&#x2F;Z bypasses or privilege escalations. This limitation is a result of their core architecture. By design, SAST tools parse code into a simplistic model like an AST or call graph, which quickly loses context in dynamically typed languages or across microservice boundaries, and limits coverage to only resolving basic call chains. When detecting vulnerabilities they rely on pattern matching with Regex or YAML rules, which can be effective for basic technical classes like (XSS, SQLi) but inadequate for logic flaws that don’t conform to well-known shapes and need long sequences of dependent operations to reach an exploitable state.<p>My co-founder and I saw these limitations throughout our careers in national intelligence and military cyber forces, where we built automated tooling to defend critical infrastructure. We realised that LLMs, with the right architecture, could finally solve them.<p>Vulnerabilities are contextual. What&#x27;s exploitable depends entirely on each application&#x27;s security model. We realized accurate detection requires understanding what&#x27;s supposed to be protected and why breaking it matters. This meant embedding threat modeling directly into our analysis, not treating it as an afterthought.<p>To achieve this, we first had to solve the code parsing problem. Our solution was to build a custom, compiler-accurate indexer inspired by GitHub&#x27;s stack graphs approach to precisely navigate code, like an IDE. We build on the LSIF approach (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev&#x2F;</a>) but replace the verbose JSON with a compact protobuf schema to serialise symbol definitions and references in a binary format. We use language‑specific tools to parse and type‑check code, emitting a sequence of Protobuf messages that record a symbol’s position, definition, and reference information. By using Protobuf’s efficiency and strong typing, we can produce smaller indexes, but also preserve the compiler‑accurate semantic information required for detecting complex call chains.<p>This is why most &quot;SAST + LLM&quot; tools that use AST parsing fail - they feed LLMs incomplete or incorrect code information from traditional parsers, making it difficult to accurately reason about security issues with missing context.<p>With our indexer providing accurate code structure, we use an LLM to perform threat modeling by analyzing developer intent, data and trust boundaries, and exposed endpoints to generate potential attack scenarios. This is where LLMs&#x27; tendency to hallucinate becomes a breakthrough feature.<p>For each potential attack path generated, we perform a systematic search, querying the indexer to gather all necessary context and reconstruct the full call chain from source to sink. To validate the vulnerability we use a Monte Carlo Tree Self-refine (MCTSr) algorithm and a &#x27;win function&#x27; to determine the likelihood that a hypothesized attack could work. Once a finding is above a set practicality threshold it is confirmed as a true positive.<p>Using this approach, we discovered vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-51479 in ONYX (an OSS enterprise search platform) where Curators could modify any group instead of just their assigned ones. The user-group API had a user parameter that should check permissions but never used it. Gecko inferred developers intended to restrict Curator access because both the UI and similar API functions properly validated this permission. This established &quot;curators have limited scope&quot; as a security invariant that this specific API violated. Traditional SAST can&#x27;t detect this. Any rule to flag unused user parameters would drown you in false positives since many functions legitimately keep unused parameters. And more importantly, detecting this requires knowing which functions handle authorization, understanding ONYX&#x27;s Curator permission model, and recognizing the validation pattern across multiple files - contextual reasoning that SAST simply cannot do.<p>We have several enterprise customers using Gecko because it solves problems they couldn&#x27;t address with traditional SAST tools. They&#x27;re seeing 50% fewer false positives on the same codebases and finding vulnerabilities that previously only showed up in manual pentests.<p>Digging into false positives, no static analysis tool will ever achieve perfect accuracy, AI or otherwise. We reduce them at two key points. First, our indexer eliminates any programmatic parsing errors that create incorrect call chains that traditional AST tools are susceptible to. Second, we avoid unwanted LLM hallucinations and reasoning errors by asking specific, contextual questions rather than open-ended ones. The LLM knows which security invariants need to hold and can make deterministic assessments based on the context. When we do flag something, manual review is quick because we provide complete source-to-sink dataflow analysis with proof-of-concept code and output findings based on confidence scores.<p>We’d love to get any feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I’ll be in the comments to respond!",

We&#x27;re building AgentMail (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentmail.to&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentmail.to&#x2F;</a>), an API to give AI agents their own email inboxes. We’re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.<p>We started building email agents because they can converse with users in their inboxes, automate email-based workflows, and authenticate with third-party applications. Given these unique capabilities, we think email will be a core interface for agents.<p>But we were building on top of Gmail, which was a struggle: poor API support, expensive subscriptions, rate limits, sending limits, GCP Pub&#x2F;Sub, OAuth, crappy keyword search, and an overall terrible developer experience.<p>Gmail and other providers didn’t work for us. So we decided to bite the bullet and build our own.<p>AgentMail is like Gmail, but API-first, with programmatic inbox creation, events over webhooks and websockets, simple API key auth, organization-wide semantic search, structured data extraction, and usage-based pricing that scales with emails sent&#x2F;received.<p>Here’s a demo of building an email agent: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1V7BISeFUTM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1V7BISeFUTM</a>, and here’s a demo of a voice agent with its own email inbox: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eG2fCsRK4RY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eG2fCsRK4RY</a><p>So far AgentMail has been deployed to use cases such as apps with dedicated inboxes for each user, voice agents that receive documents in real time, automated account provisioning and QA testing, cold outbound platforms with thousands of inboxes, automations for processing invoices, and agents that coordinate work with humans and other agents.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. You can try our playground at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.agentmail.to\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.agentmail.to</a>",

You just call lai.init() in your agent code and log into the dashboard. You can see traces of each run, cumulative trends across sessions, built-in or custom evals, and grouped failure modes. Call lai.create_step() with any metadata you want, memory snapshots, tool outputs, stateful info, and we&#x27;ll index it for debugging.<p>We did NLP research at Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), where we worked on creating an AI agent (w&#x2F; fine-tuned models and DSPy) to solve math olympiad problems (focusing on AIME&#x2F;USAMO); and we realized debugging these agents was hard. But the last straw was when we built an e-commerce agent that could buy items online. It kept failing at checkout, and every one-line change, tweaking a prompt, switching to Llama, adjusting tool logic, meant another 10-minute rerun just to see if we hit the same checkout page.<p>At this point, we were all like, this sucks, so we improved agent interpretability with better debugging, monitoring, and evals.<p>We started by listening to users who told us traditional LLM observability platforms don&#x27;t capture the complexity of agents. Agents have tools, memories, events, not just input&#x2F;output pairs. So we automatically transform OTel (and&#x2F;or regular) agent logs into interactive graph visualizations that cluster similar states based on memory and action patterns.\nWe heard that people wanted to test small changes even with the graphs, so we created “time traveling,” where you can modify any state (memory contents, tool outputs, context), then re-simulate 30–40 times to see outcome distributions. We embed the responses, cluster by similarity, and show which modifications lead to stable vs. divergent behaviors.<p>Then we saw people running their agent 10 times on the same task, watching each run individually, and wasting hours looking at mostly repeated states. So we built trajectory clustering on similar state embeddings (like similar tools or memories) to surface behavioral patterns across mass simulations.<p>We then use that to create a force-directed layout that automatically groups similar paths your agent took, which displays states as nodes, actions as edges, and failure probability as color intensity. The clusters make failure patterns obvious; you see trends across hundreds of runs, not individual traces.<p>Finally, when people saw our observability features, they naturally wanted evaluation capabilities. So we developed a concept for people to make their own evals called &quot;rubrics,&quot; which lets you define specific criteria, assign weights to each criterion, and set score definitions,  giving you a structured way to measure agent performance against your exact requirements.<p>To evaluate these criteria, we used our own platform to build an investigator agent that reviews your criteria and evaluates performance much more effectively than traditional LLM-as-a-judge approaches.<p>To get started visit dashboard.lucidic.ai and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.lucidic.ai&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quickstart\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.lucidic.ai&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quickstart</a>. You can use it for free for 1,000 event and step creations.<p>Look forward to your thoughts! And don’t hesitate to reach out at team@lucidic.ai",

      "text": "Hi HN, Dylan and Shima here. Today we&#x27;re launching the first version of our project, Safe Rate, an AI-native mortgage lender going all in on the chat experience, at saferate.com.<p>Mortgage shopping is an uncomfortable experience.  You have to share lots of sensitive data to get a single quote, and if you want to comparison shop, the rate aggregator websites straight up sell your data, so you end up with a lot of texts, emails, and phone calls from salespeople you&#x27;ve never met asking you to blindly trust them with a big financial decision.<p>Getting a mortgage quote should be on your terms. You should be able to share your relevant details anonymously and get real pricing.  You should know how competitive the offer is before speaking with someone.  And you should still be able to connect with a human if you need support.<p>So we&#x27;ve built a suite of tools in our AI chat to put shoppers in control:<p>1. Instant mortgage quoting without sharing any sensitive data (currently live for conventional loans in Illinois)<p>2. Automatically review a Loan Estimate, which every lender must provide you by law, and see how the estimate scores (0 to 100, benchmarked against 2 million loans).  We then can make an instant competing offer so you know if we can save you money.<p>3. For refinances, share a mortgage statement to see if you can save money today, and if not, create a personalized tracker so you can be notified when rates have fallen<p>4. Mortgage Q&amp;A for commonly asked mortgage questions.  Still lots more to add!<p>5. Live - a Zoom-like call for mortgage shopping that instantly connects you with a loan officer while our AI assistant listens in, updates the quote details, and gets you pricing<p>We support this functionality in a variety of ways:<p>1. Chat on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saferate.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saferate.com</a><p>2. Email at buddy@saferate.ai<p>3. Live via our Zoom-like call tailored to mortgage shopping<p>4. Slackbot (please ask if you&#x27;re interested in access)<p>5. Phone 1(888)850-6123<p>6. Coming soon RCS, SMS, and WhatsApp<p>Our chats are universal, so you can start with email and then transition to web chat, or vice versa, and it will retain the full context.  And we&#x27;ve built our chat to be embeddable on any other website via an iframe.  Safe Rate&#x27;s main chat is actually an embedded iframe itself. And because we can&#x27;t be wrong when giving a mortgage quote (regulation!) we&#x27;ve designed our AI so it does not hallucinate.<p>Here’s a 90 second demo video that shows this in action: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;6eIJukspmfU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;6eIJukspmfU</a><p>You can also see a sample Live session: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;alAPtjUJ5xE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;alAPtjUJ5xE</a><p>We&#x27;re posting here today because any testing or feedback would be a great help.  We&#x27;re able to join the Live Call if you&#x27;re brave enough (in addition to building this system ourselves, we&#x27;re also licensed loan officers).  And our quotes are only valid for Illinois with a max loan size of $806,500. We hope to expand nationally soon.  Thanks!",

We&#x27;re building an open-source, privacy-first AI note-taking app that runs fully on-device. Think of it as an open-source Granola. No Zoom bots, no cloud APIs, no data ever leaves your machine.<p>Source code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote</a>\nDemo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyprnote.com&#x2F;demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyprnote.com&#x2F;demo</a><p>We built Hyprnote because some of our friends told us that their companies banned certain meeting notetakers due to data concerns, or they simply felt uncomfortable sending data to unknown servers. So they went back to manual note-taking - losing focus during meetings and wasting time afterward.<p>We asked: could we build something just as useful, but completely local?<p>Hyprnote is a desktop app that transcribes and summarizes meetings on-device. It captures both your mic input and system audio, so you don&#x27;t need to invite bots. It generates a summary based on the notes you take. Everything runs on local AI models by default, using Whisper and HyprLLM. HyprLLM is our proof-of-concept model fine-tuned from Qwen3 1.7B. We learned that summarizing meetings is a very nuanced task and that a model&#x27;s raw intelligence (or weight) doesn&#x27;t matter THAT much. We&#x27;ll release more details on evaluation and training once we finish the 2nd iteration of the model (still not that good  we can make it a lot better).<p>Whisper inference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;whisper-local&#x2F;src&#x2F;model.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;whispe...</a><p>AEC inference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;aec&#x2F;src&#x2F;lib.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;aec&#x2F;sr...</a><p>LLM inference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;llama&#x2F;src&#x2F;lib.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;llama&#x2F;...</a><p>We also learned that for some folks, having full data controllability was as important as privacy. So we support custom endpoints, allowing users to bring in their company&#x27;s internal LLM. For teams that need integrations, collaboration, or admin controls, we&#x27;re working on an optional server component that can be self-hosted. Lastly, we&#x27;re exploring ways to make Hyprnote work like VSCode, so you can install extensions and build your own workflows around your meetings.<p>We believe privacy-first tools, powered by local models, are going to unlock the next wave of real-world AI apps.<p>We&#x27;re here and looking forward to your comments!",

Nova leverages Erlang&#x27;s concurrency, reliability, and scalability to create a robust yet lightweight framework for building modern web applications.<p>Key features:<p>* Lightweight and modular: Easy to integrate with existing Erlang projects.<p>* Built for concurrency: Harnesses Erlang&#x27;s actor model for high-performance web apps.<p>* Developer-friendly: Simplifies routing, middleware, and template handling.<p>* Extensible: Supports plugins and custom integrations.<p>Check it out:\nGitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;novaframework&#x2F;nova\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;novaframework&#x2F;nova</a>\nHomepage: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;novaframework.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;novaframework.org</a>\nGetting Started Guide: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;taure&#x2F;getting-started-with-nova-1ioo&#x2F;stats\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;taure&#x2F;getting-started-with-nova-1ioo&#x2F;stats</a><p>We’re early in development and would love feedback from the community! If you’re an Erlang enthusiast or curious about building web apps with a language known for its reliability (think WhatsApp or RabbitMQ), give Nova a spin and let us know your thoughts.<p>What do you think about using Erlang for web development? Any features you’d love to see in a framework like this?",
