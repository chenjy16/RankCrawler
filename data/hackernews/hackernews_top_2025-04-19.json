      "text": "Hey HN, we&#x27;re Eliza and Xin, and we’ve been working on Attune. Attune is a tool for publishing Linux packages.<p>Previously, we worked at other startups building open source developer tools that ran on our customers’ CI and development machines. For many of them, being able to `apt-get install` our tools was a requirement.<p>When we went to actually set up APT repositories, we were really surprised by the state of tooling around package publishing. The open source tools we found were old, slow, and difficult to figure out how to run in CI. The commercial tools we found were not much better. The cloud-hosted vendors required us to provide our signing keys to a cloud vendor (which was a non-starter), while the self-hosted vendors required us to operate our own specialized hosting servers.<p>We just wanted something simple: sign locally, run quickly, be easy to use, and deploy to managed object storage.<p>We couldn’t find it, so we built it. If you want to try it out, you can create a repository with three commands:<p><pre><code>    attune repo create --uri https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apt.releases.example.com\n    attune repo pkg add --repo-id 123 package.deb\n    attune repo sync --repo-id 123\n</code></pre>\nYou can get the tool at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;attunehq&#x2F;attune\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;attunehq&#x2F;attune</a>. There are a lot of rough edges right now since it&#x27;s so new - sorry in advance, we&#x27;re working on sanding those down.<p>It’s fully open source under Apache 2. We’re also working with some early customers to build enterprise features like audit logging, RBAC, and HSM integrations, and we’re thinking about building a managed cloud hosting service as well.<p>We’d love your feedback on whether this is useful for you, and what you’d like to see next. We’re well aware that publishing is a small piece of CI&#x2F;CD, but we think a lot of the tooling in this area (publishing, artifact registries, package repositories) could really use some love.<p>What do you think? Comment here, or email us at founders@attunehq.com.",

      "text": "Earlier this year, I took a month to reexamine my coding habits and rethink some past design choices. I hope to rewrite and improve my FOSS libraries this year, and I needed answers to a few questions first. Perhaps some of these questions will resonate with others in the community, too.<p><pre><code>  - Are coroutines viable for high-performance work?\n  - Should I use SIMD intrinsics for clarity or drop to assembly for easier library distribution?\n  - Has hardware caught up with vectorized scatter&#x2F;gather in AVX-512 &amp; SVE?\n  - How do secure enclaves &amp; pointer tagging differ on Intel, Arm, &amp; AMD?\n  - What&#x27;s the throughput gap between CPU and GPU Tensor Cores (TCs)?\n  - How costly are misaligned memory accesses &amp; split-loads, and what gains do non-temporal loads&#x2F;stores offer?\n  - Which parts of the standard library hit performance hardest?\n  - How do error-handling strategies compare overhead-wise?\n  - What&#x27;s the compile-time vs. run-time trade-off for lazily evaluated ranges?\n  - What practical, non-trivial use cases exist for meta-programming?\n  - How challenging is Linux Kernel bypass with io_uring vs. POSIX sockets?\n  - How close are we to effectively using Networking TS or heterogeneous Executors in C++?\n  - What are best practices for propagating stateful allocators in nested containers, and which libraries support them?\n</code></pre>\nThese questions span from micro-kernel optimizations (nanoseconds) to distributed systems (micro&#x2F;millisecond latencies). Rather than tackling them all in one post, I compiled my explorations into a repository—extending my previous Google Benchmark tutorial (&lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ashvardanian.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;google-benchmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ashvardanian.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;google-benchmark</a>&gt;)—to serve as a sandbox for performance experimentation.<p>Some fun observations:<p><pre><code>  - Compilers now vectorize 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 single&#x2F;double precision multiplications well! The smaller one is ~60% slower despite 70% fewer operations, outperforming my vanilla SSE&#x2F;AVX and coming within 10% of AVX-512.\n\n  - Nvidia TCs vary dramatically across generations in numeric types, throughput, tile shapes, thread synchronization (thread&#x2F;quad-pair&#x2F;warp&#x2F;warp-groups), and operand storage. Post-Volta, manual PTX is often needed (as intrinsics lag), though the new TileIR (introduced at GTC) promises improvements for dense linear algebra kernels.\n\n  - The AI wave drives CPUs and GPUs to converge in mat-mul throughput &amp; programming complexity. It took me a day to debug TMM register initialization, and SME is equally odd. Sierra Forest packs 288 cores&#x2F;socket, and AVX10.2 drops 256-bit support for 512-bit... I wonder if discrete Intel GPUs are even needed, given CPU advances?\n\n  - In common floating-point ranges, scalar sine approximations can be up to 40x faster than standard implementations, even without SIMD. It&#x27;s a bit hand-wavy, though; I wish more projects documented error bounds and had 1 &amp; 3.5 ULP variants like Sleef.\n\n  - Meta-programming tools like CTRE can outperform typical RegEx engines by 5x and simplify building parsers compared to hand-crafted FSMs.\n\n  - Once clearly distinct in complexity and performance (DPDK&#x2F;SPDK vs. io_uring), the gap is narrowing. While pre-5.5 io_uring can boost UDP throughput by 4x on loopback IO, newer zero-copy and concurrency optimizations remain challenging.\n</code></pre>\nThe repository is loaded with links to favorite CppCon lectures, GitHub snippets, and tech blog posts. Recognizing that many high-level concepts are handled differently across languages, I&#x27;ve also started porting examples to Rust &amp; Python in separate repos. Coroutines look bad everywhere :(<p>Overall, this research project was rewarding! Most questions found answers in code — except pointer tagging and secure enclaves, which still elude me in public cloud. I&#x27;d love to hear from others, especially on comparing High-Level Synthesis for small matrix multiplications on FPGAs versus hand-written VHDL&#x2F;Verilog for integral types. Let me know if you have ideas for other cool, obscure topics to cover!",

      "text": "I thought the HN crowd would appreciate this story I wrote about the keeper of a university&#x27;s lab animals. In reporting articles about science, and being a biology-watcher generally, I’ve had an uneasy time squaring my enthusiasm for cutting-edge biomedical research with the fact that this research so regularly involves breeding animals just to give them diseases and kill them. This is done as humanely as possible, of course.<p>The contrast hit me most vividly during the pandemic when I was writing an article about the immune system. [1] One of the scientists I spoke to told me about putting hamsters on warming plates, picking them up gently — in general, caring for and about them — and then feeling grief at their deaths. But of course understanding the immune response during infection with covid was a worthy cause. I felt no judgement towards this scientist; they are in a difficult position.<p>There was another more direct bit of inspiration, when I read this article [2], in 2023, about the toll that caring for laboratory animals could take on people’s mental health:<p>&gt; <i>Besides the symptoms Sessions experienced, those who handle lab animals may face insomnia, chronic physical ailments, zombielike lack of empathy, and, in extreme cases, severe depression, substance abuse, and thoughts of suicide. As many as nine in 10 people in the profession will suffer from compassion fatigue at some point during their careers, according to recent research, more than twice the rate of those who work in hospital intensive care units. It’s one of the leading reasons animal care workers quit.</i><p>That left an impression on me, and also armed me with a character: the forgotten-about, somewhat miserable vivarium worker.<p>The story obviously takes many liberties with fact — it is fiction — but I also tried to ground it in reality, and stuff that you might think I made up (the guillotine, the crazy VR sphere in the first paragraph), I did not.<p>I hope you enjoy! If nothing else I expect you’ll appreciate the illustrations, done by my friend Ben Smith [3].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;how-the-coronavirus-hacks-the-immune-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;how-the-corona...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;suffering-silence-caring-research-animals-can-take-severe-mental-toll\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;article&#x2F;suffering-silence-ca...</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenbonesproductions.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenbonesproductions.com&#x2F;</a>",
