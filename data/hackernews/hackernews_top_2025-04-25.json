      "text": "Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Lemon Slice. We’ve trained a custom diffusion transformer (DiT) model that achieves video streaming at 25fps and wrapped it into a demo that allows anyone to turn a photo into a real-time, talking avatar. Here’s an example conversation from co-founder Andrew: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CeYp5xQMFZY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CeYp5xQMFZY</a>. Try it for yourself at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live</a>.<p>(Btw, we used to be called Infinity AI and did a Show HN under that name last year: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41467704\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41467704</a>.)<p>Unlike existing avatar video chat platforms like HeyGen, Tolan, or Apple Memoji filters, we do not require training custom models, rigging a character ahead of time, or having a human drive the avatar. Our tech allows users to create and immediately video-call a custom character by uploading a single image. The character image can be any style - from photorealistic to cartoons, paintings, and more.<p>To achieve this demo, we had to do the following (among other things! but these were the hardest):<p>1. Training a fast DiT model. To make our video generation fast, we had to both design a model that made the right trade-offs between speed and quality, and use standard distillation approaches. We first trained a custom video diffusion transformer (DiT) from scratch that achieves excellent lip and facial expression sync to audio. To further optimize the model for speed, we applied teacher-student distillation. The distilled model achieves 25fps video generation at 256-px resolution. Purpose-built transformer ASICs will eventually allow us to stream our video model at 4k resolution.<p>2. Solving the infinite video problem. Most video DiT models (Sora, Runway, Kling) generate 5-second chunks. They can iteratively extend it by another 5sec by feeding the end of the 1st chunk into the start of the 2nd in an autoregressive manner. Unfortunately the models experience quality degradation after multiple extensions due to accumulation of generation errors. We developed a temporal consistency preservation technique that maintains visual coherence across long sequences. Our technique significantly reduces artifact accumulation and allows us to generate indefinitely-long videos.<p>3. A complex streaming architecture with minimal latency. Enabling an end-to-end avatar zoom call requires several building blocks, including voice transcription, LLM inference, and text-to-speech generation in addition to video generation. We use Deepgram as our AI voice partner. Modal as the end-to-end compute platform. And Daily.co and Pipecat to help build a parallel processing pipeline that orchestrates everything via continuously streaming chunks. Our system achieves end-to-end latency of 3-6 seconds from user input to avatar response. Our target is &lt;2 second latency.<p>More technical details here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;technical-report\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemonslice.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;technical-report</a>.<p>Current limitations that we want to solve include: (1) enabling whole-body and background motions (we’re training a next-gen model for this), (2) reducing delays and improving resolution (purpose-built ASICs will help), (3) training a model on dyadic conversations so that avatars learn to listen naturally, and (4) allowing the character to “see you” and respond to what they see to create a more natural and engaging conversation.<p>We believe that generative video will usher in a new media type centered around interactivity: TV shows, movies, ads, and online courses will stop and talk to us. Our entertainment will be a mixture of passive and active experiences depending on what we’re in the mood for. Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future, but that’s how we see it anyway!<p>We’d love for you to try out the demo and let us know what you think!

Here&#x27;s a quick demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wp1hoSCEArg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wp1hoSCEArg</a><p>As a heavy Notion user, I often found it tough to get my teams fully onboard since people naturally gravitate toward chat for quick interactions. Maintaining context between chat apps like Slack and documentation apps like Notion became increasingly frustrating. Switching contexts, losing track of information, and managing data across multiple tools created unnecessary friction.<p>This frustration led me to build Colanode, a single platform integrating structured notes and knowledge management with real-time chat. After building the first version, early feedback highlighted a critical issue: teams&#x2F;organizations want full control over sensitive data, especially conversations. That&#x27;s why I decided to open-source Colanode under an Apache 2.0 license, making it fully self-hostable so you can retain complete ownership and privacy over your data.<p>Colanode is built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, using only open-source tools and avoiding any vendor or cloud lock-in. It features a local-first architecture offering complete offline support. From a technical perspective, Colanode consists of a Node.js server API and an Electron desktop client, with mobile apps coming soon. Everything in Colanode is represented as a node (e.g., message, file, folder, chat, channel, database, record), each with specific attributes and permissions. All reads and writes performed by the desktop client happen locally within a SQLite database, and changes sync seamlessly via a synchronization engine built on top of SQLite, Postgres, and Yjs—a CRDT library for conflict resolution. The server then propagates these changes to other collaborators. You can self-host the server in any environment using Docker, Postgres, Redis, and any S3-compatible storage, and connect using the official desktop client, which supports simultaneous connections to multiple servers and accounts. This local-first approach also prepares us for future integrations with fully local LLMs, further enhancing privacy and performance.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback and suggestions on Colanode. What features would you like to see? What would you change?<p>Thanks, looking forward to your thoughts!",

But giving full access to your host device is risky. What if the agent&#x27;s process gets compromised, or the LLM hallucinates and leaks your data? And practically speaking, do you really want to give up control of your entire machine just so the agent can do its job?<p>The idea behind c&#x2F;ua is simple: let agents operate in a mirror of the user’s system - isolated, secure, and disposable - so users can fire-and-forget complex tasks without needing to dedicate their entire system to the agent. By running in a virtualized environment, agents can carry out their work without interrupting your workflow or risking the integrity of your system.<p>While exploring this idea, I discovered Apple’s Virtualization.Framework and realized it offered fast and lightweight virtualization on Apple Silicon. This led us to build a high-performance virtualization layer and, eventually, a computer-use interface that allows agents to interact with apps just like a human would - without taking over the entire system.<p>As we built this, we decided to open-source the virtualization core as a standalone CLI tool called Lume (Show HN here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061</a>). c&#x2F;ua builds on top of Lume, providing a full framework for running agent workflows inside secure macOS or Linux VMs, so your system stays free for you to use while the agent works its magic in the background.<p>With Cua you can build an AI agent within a virtual environment to: - navigate and interact with any application&#x27;s interface; - read screen content and perform keyboard&#x2F;mouse actions; - switch between applications and self-debug when needed; - operate in a secure sandbox with controlled file access. All of this occurs in a fully isolated environment, ensuring your host system, files, and sensitive data remain completely secure, while you continue using your device without interruption.<p>People are using c&#x2F;ua to: - Bypass CryptoJS-based encryption and anti-bot measures to interact with modern web apps reliably; - Automate Tableau dashboards and export insights via Claude Desktop; - Drive Photoshop for batch image editing by prompt; - Modify 3D models in Fusion 360 with a CAD Copilot; -Extract data from legacy ERP apps without brittle screen‑scraping scripts.<p>We’re currently working on multi‑VM orchestration for parallel agentic workflows, Windows and Linux VM support, and episodic and long-term memory for CUA Agents.<p>On the open‑source side, c&#x2F;ua is 100 % free under the MIT license - run it locally with any LLM you like. We’re also gearing up a hosted orchestration service for teams who want zero‑ops setup (early access sign‑ups opening soon).<p>We’d love to hear from you. What desktop or legacy apps do you wish you could automate? Any thoughts, feedback, or horror stories from fragile AI automations are more than welcome!",

There are lots of opportunities for how to develop the product further. It&#x27;s been an extremely hard scale-up but we are finally starting to see it pay off.<p>I&#x27;m struggling with the CEO being increasingly focussed on investing heavily in AI. I&#x27;m not opposed to using this tech at all – it&#x27;s amazing, and we incorporate a variety of different ML models across our stack where they are useful. But this strategy has evolved to the point where we are limiting resource on key teams aligned with core business to invest in an AI team.<p>The argument seems to be that they&#x27;ve realized the only way to achieve the next round of funding is to be &quot;AI-first&quot;. There is no product roadmap for what this looks like, or what features might be involved, or why we&#x27;d want to do it from a product point of view. Instead the reason is that this is the only way to attract a big series C round.<p>I&#x27;m not well-informed enough to know if this is the correct approach to scaling. Instead of working on useful, in-demand product features, it feels like we&#x27;re spending a lot of time looking at a distant future that we&#x27;ll struggle to reach if we take our eye off of the ball. Is this normal? Are other organizations going through the same struggle? For the first time in five years I feel completely out of my depth.",

We essentially created browser agent observability. We patched Playwright to record the entire browser session while the agent operates, simultaneously tracing all agent steps and LLM calls. Then we synchronized everything in the UI, creating an unparalleled debugging experience. This allowed us to pinpoint exactly where the agent fails by seeing what it &quot;sees&quot; in session replay alongside execution traces.<p>2. Our detection script is simple but extremely good. It&#x27;s carefully crafted via trial and error. We also employed CV and OCR.<p>3. Agent is very simple, literally just a while loop. All power comes from carefully crafted prompt and ton of eval runs.<p>Index is a simple python package. It also comes with a beautiful CLI.<p>pip install lmnr-index<p>playwright install chromium<p>index run<p>We&#x27;ve recently added o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash.

We’re Arjun, Ramnique, and Akhilesh, and we are building Rowboat  (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;</a>), an AI-assisted IDE for building and managing multi-agent systems. You start with a single agent, then scale up to teams of agents that work together, use MCP tools, and improve over time - all through a chat-based copilot.<p>Our repo is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rowboatlabs&#x2F;rowboat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rowboatlabs&#x2F;rowboat</a>, docs are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;</a>, and there’s a demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YRTCw9UHRbU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YRTCw9UHRbU</a><p>It’s becoming clear that real-world agentic systems work best when multiple agents collaborate, rather than having one agent attempt to do everything. This isn’t too surprising - it’s a bit like how good code consists of multiple functions that each do one thing, rather than cramming everything into one function.<p>For example, a travel assistant works best when different agents handle specialized tasks: one agent finds the best flights, another optimizes hotel selections, and a third organizes the itinerary. This modular approach makes the system easier to manage, debug, and improve over time.<p>OpenAI’s Agents SDK provides a neat Python library to support this, but building reliable agentic systems requires constant iterations and tweaking - e.g. updating agent instructions (which can quickly get as complex as actual code), connecting tools, and testing the system and incorporating feedback. Rowboat is an AI IDE to do all this. Rowboat is to AI agents what Cursor is to code.<p>We’ve taken a code-like approach to agent instructions (prompts). There are special keywords to directly reference other agents, tools or prompts - which are highlighted in the UI. The copilot is the best way to create and edit these instructions - each change comes with a code-style diff.<p>You can give agents access to tools by integrating any MCP server or connecting your own functions through a webhook. You can instruct the agents on when to use specific tools via ‘@mentions’ in the agent instruction. To enable quick testing, we added a way to mock tool responses using LLM calls.<p>Rowboat playground lets you test and debug the assistants as you build them. You can see agent transfers, tool invocations and tool responses in real-time. The copilot has the context of the chat, and can improve the agent instructions based on feedback. For example, you could say ‘The agent shouldn’t have done x here. Fix this’ and the copilot can go and make this fix.<p>You can integrate agentic systems built in Rowboat into your application via the HTTP API or the Python SDK (‘pip install rowboat’). For example, you can build user-facing chatbots, enterprise workflows and employee assistants using Rowboat.<p>We’ve been working with LLMs since GPT-1 launched in 2018. Most recently, we built Coinbase’s support chatbot after our last AI startup was acquired by them.<p>Rowboat is Apache 2.0 licensed, giving you full freedom to self-host, modify, or extend it however you like.<p>We’re excited to share Rowboat with everyone here. We’d love to hear your thoughts!",

So instead of passively watching videos, you can jump in an experiment with the code directly inside the video player. Since launch, almost two million people have used Scrimba to grow their skills.<p>However, one limitation is that we&#x27;ve only supported frontend code, as our interactive videos run in the browser, whereas most of our learners want to go fullstack—building APIs, handling auth, working with databases, and so forth.<p>To fix this, we spent the last 6 months integrating StackBlitz WebContainers into Scrimba. This enables a full Node.js environment—including a terminal, shell, npm access, and a virtual file system—directly inside our video player. Everything runs in the browser.<p>Here is a 2-minute recorded demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;s08dpq3nom\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;s08dpq3nom</a><p>If you want to see more, feel free to enroll into any of the seven fullstack courses we&#x27;ve launched so far, on subject like Node, Next, Express, SQL, Vite, and more. We&#x27;ve opened them up for Hacker News today so that you don&#x27;t even need to create an account to watch the content:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;fullstack\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;fullstack</a><p><i>Other notable highlights about our &quot;IDE videos&quot;:</i><p>- Based on events (code edits, cursor moves, etc) instead of pixels<p>- Roughly 100x smaller than traditional videos<p>- Recording is simple: just talk while you code<p>- Can be embedded in blogs, docs, or courses, like MDN does here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;curriculum&#x2F;core&#x2F;css-fundamentals&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;curriculum&#x2F;core&#x2F;css-fund...</a><p>- Entirely built in Imba, a language I created myself: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28207662\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28207662</a><p>We think this format could be useful for open-source maintainers and API-focused teams looking to create interactive docs or walkthroughs. Our videos are already embedded by MDN, LangChain, and Coursera.<p>If you maintain a library or SDK and want an interactive video about it, let us know—happy to record one for free that you can use however you like.<p>Would love to answer any questions or hear people&#x27;s feedback!",
