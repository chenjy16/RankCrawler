You can read more about it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trymeka&#x2F;webarena_evals\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trymeka&#x2F;webarena_evals</a>.<p>Today, we are open sourcing Meka, our state of the art agent, to allow anyone to build their own powerful, vision-based agents from scratch. We provide the groundwork for the hard parts, so you don&#x27;t have to:<p>* True vision-based control: Meka doesn&#x27;t just read HTML. It looks at the screen, identifies interactive elements, and decides where to click, type, and scroll.<p>* Full computer access: It&#x27;s not sandboxed in a browser. Meka operates with OS-level controls, allowing it to handle system dialogues, file uploads, and other interactions that browser-only automation tools can&#x27;t.<p>* Extensible by design: We&#x27;ve made it easy to plug in your own LLMs and computer providers.<p>* State-of-the-art performance: 72.7% on WebArena<p>Our goal is to enable developers to create repeatable, robust tasks on any computer just by prompting an agent, without worrying about the implementation details.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on how this tool could fit into your automation workflows. Try it out and let us know what you think.<p>You can find the repo on GitHub and get started quickly with our hosted platform, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.withmeka.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.withmeka.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>Thanks,\nWinston, Edward, and James",

      "text": "Hi HN, we’re Abhinav, Andy, and Jeremy, and we’re building Lucidic AI (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.lucidic.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.lucidic.ai</a>), an AI agent interpretability tool to help observe&#x2F;debug AI agents.<p>Here is a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Zvoh1QUMhXQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Zvoh1QUMhXQ</a>.<p>Getting started is easy with just one line of code. You just call lai.init() in your agent code and log into the dashboard. You can see traces of each run, cumulative trends across sessions, built-in or custom evals, and grouped failure modes. Call lai.create_step() with any metadata you want, memory snapshots, tool outputs, stateful info, and we&#x27;ll index it for debugging.<p>We did NLP research at Stanford AI Lab (SAIL), where we worked on creating an AI agent (w&#x2F; fine-tuned models and DSPy) to solve math olympiad problems (focusing on AIME&#x2F;USAMO); and we realized debugging these agents was hard. But the last straw was when we built an e-commerce agent that could buy items online. It kept failing at checkout, and every one-line change, tweaking a prompt, switching to Llama, adjusting tool logic, meant another 10-minute rerun just to see if we hit the same checkout page.<p>At this point, we were all like, this sucks, so we improved agent interpretability with better debugging, monitoring, and evals.<p>We started by listening to users who told us traditional LLM observability platforms don&#x27;t capture the complexity of agents. Agents have tools, memories, events, not just input&#x2F;output pairs. So we automatically transform OTel (and&#x2F;or regular) agent logs into interactive graph visualizations that cluster similar states based on memory and action patterns.\nWe heard that people wanted to test small changes even with the graphs, so we created “time traveling,” where you can modify any state (memory contents, tool outputs, context), then re-simulate 30–40 times to see outcome distributions. We embed the responses, cluster by similarity, and show which modifications lead to stable vs. divergent behaviors.<p>Then we saw people running their agent 10 times on the same task, watching each run individually, and wasting hours looking at mostly repeated states. So we built trajectory clustering on similar state embeddings (like similar tools or memories) to surface behavioral patterns across mass simulations.<p>We then use that to create a force-directed layout that automatically groups similar paths your agent took, which displays states as nodes, actions as edges, and failure probability as color intensity. The clusters make failure patterns obvious; you see trends across hundreds of runs, not individual traces.<p>Finally, when people saw our observability features, they naturally wanted evaluation capabilities. So we developed a concept for people to make their own evals called &quot;rubrics,&quot; which lets you define specific criteria, assign weights to each criterion, and set score definitions,  giving you a structured way to measure agent performance against your exact requirements.<p>To evaluate these criteria, we used our own platform to build an investigator agent that reviews your criteria and evaluates performance much more effectively than traditional LLM-as-a-judge approaches.<p>To get started visit dashboard.lucidic.ai and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.lucidic.ai&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quickstart\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.lucidic.ai&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quickstart</a>. You can use it for free for 1,000 event and step creations.<p>Look forward to your thoughts! And don’t hesitate to reach out at team@lucidic.ai",

      "text": "Hey HN! My name is Christian, and I’m the co-founder of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frigade.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frigade.ai</a>. We’ve built an AI agent that automatically learns how to use any web-based product, and in turn guides users directly in the UI, automatically generates documentation, and even takes actions on a user’s behalf. Think of it as Clippy from the old MS Office. But on steroids. And actually helpful.<p>You can see the agent and tool-calling SDK in action here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UPe0t3A1Vpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UPe0t3A1Vpg</a><p>How is this different from other AI customer support products?<p>Most AI &quot;copilots&quot; are really just glorified chatbots. They skim your help center and spit out some nonspecific bullet points. Basically some ‘hopes and prayers’ that your users will figure it out. Ultimately, this puts the burden on the user to follow through. And assumes companies are keeping their help center up-to-date with every product change. That means constant screenshots of new product UI or features for accurate instructions.These solutions leverage only a fraction of what’s possible with AI, which can now reason about software interfaces extensively.<p>With Frigade AI, we guide the user directly in the product and build on-demand tours based on the current user’s state and context. The agents can also take actions immediately on a user’s behalf, e.g. inviting a colleague to a workspace or retrieving billing information (via our tool calling SDK).<p>This was only made possible recently. The latest frontier models (GPT 4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) are able to reason about UIs and workflows in a way that simply didn’t work just 6 months ago. That’s why we’re so excited to bring this technology to the forefront of complex legacy SaaS applications that are not yet AI enabled.<p>How does it work?<p>1. Invite agent@frigade.ai to your product. You can send multiple invitations based on distinct roles.<p>2. Our agent automatically explores and reasons about your application.<p>3. Attach any existing help center resources or training documentation to supplement the agent’s understanding. Totally optional.<p>4. Install the agent assistant Javascript snippet (just a few lines).<p>5. That’s it. Your users can now start asking questions and get on demand product tours and questions answered in real time without any overhead.<p>This process takes only a few minutes. Once running, you can improve the agent by rating and providing feedback to the responses it provides. If you want to integrate further, you can also hook up your own code to our tool calling SDK to enable the agent to look up customer info, issue refunds, etc. directly. These calls can be made with just a few lines of code by describing the tool and its parameters in natural language and passing a single Javascript promise (e.g. make an API call, call a function in your app, etc.).<p>Would love to hear what the HN crowd thinks about this approach! Are you building your own AI agent from scratch, or looking to embed one off the shelf?",

We&#x27;re building an open-source, privacy-first AI note-taking app that runs fully on-device. Think of it as an open-source Granola. No Zoom bots, no cloud APIs, no data ever leaves your machine.<p>Source code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote</a>\nDemo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyprnote.com&#x2F;demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyprnote.com&#x2F;demo</a><p>We built Hyprnote because some of our friends told us that their companies banned certain meeting notetakers due to data concerns, or they simply felt uncomfortable sending data to unknown servers. So they went back to manual note-taking - losing focus during meetings and wasting time afterward.<p>We asked: could we build something just as useful, but completely local?<p>Hyprnote is a desktop app that transcribes and summarizes meetings on-device. It captures both your mic input and system audio, so you don&#x27;t need to invite bots. It generates a summary based on the notes you take. Everything runs on local AI models by default, using Whisper and HyprLLM. HyprLLM is our proof-of-concept model fine-tuned from Qwen3 1.7B. We learned that summarizing meetings is a very nuanced task and that a model&#x27;s raw intelligence (or weight) doesn&#x27;t matter THAT much. We&#x27;ll release more details on evaluation and training once we finish the 2nd iteration of the model (still not that good  we can make it a lot better).<p>Whisper inference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;whisper-local&#x2F;src&#x2F;model.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;whispe...</a><p>AEC inference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;aec&#x2F;src&#x2F;lib.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;aec&#x2F;sr...</a><p>LLM inference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;llama&#x2F;src&#x2F;lib.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fastrepl&#x2F;hyprnote&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crates&#x2F;llama&#x2F;...</a><p>We also learned that for some folks, having full data controllability was as important as privacy. So we support custom endpoints, allowing users to bring in their company&#x27;s internal LLM. For teams that need integrations, collaboration, or admin controls, we&#x27;re working on an optional server component that can be self-hosted. Lastly, we&#x27;re exploring ways to make Hyprnote work like VSCode, so you can install extensions and build your own workflows around your meetings.<p>We believe privacy-first tools, powered by local models, are going to unlock the next wave of real-world AI apps.<p>We&#x27;re here and looking forward to your comments!",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on this for a while now, and I&#x27;m happy to share!<p>I&#x27;ve been into launching weather balloons for a few years. One aspect of the hobby that really drew me in was the tracking side of things. Tracking systems let you follow the balloon&#x27;s position throughout the flight and, most importantly, know exactly where it lands so you can recover the instrumentation. APRS is what I started out using during my first few years in the hobby, after I got my amateur radio license in 2020 (W0MXX). I designed a few small boards using the trackuino (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trackuino&#x2F;trackuino\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trackuino&#x2F;trackuino</a>) firmware (while breaking 3 $70 radio modules along the way).<p>I then got into recovering radiosondes, which are launched twice per day by the NWS and can be reprogrammed using RS41ng (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikaelnousiainen&#x2F;RS41ng\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikaelnousiainen&#x2F;RS41ng</a>) to run many amateur radio tracking protocols. I was a bit dissatisfied with how large and heavy the radiosonde trackers were, so I designed my own tracking system, called Tiny4FSK.<p>Tiny4FSK is a flight computer with built-in tracking using the Horus Binary v2 tracking system. This protocol was developed by the Project Horus team specifically for high-altitude balloons, and it brings features like high transmit rates, forward error correction, and excellent weak-signal performance in an open source package. It&#x27;s designed to be as compact as possible and can run on a single AA battery for upwards of 17 hours.<p>The main board comes with header rows that allow for out-of-the-box expansion. I developed a shield that supports the BME280 environmental sensor, the ICM-20948 9-axis IMU, and more via the Qwiic connector. It also features an OLED display for basic diagnostics.<p>While I&#x27;ve pretty much polished the main tracking procedures (and have tested on multiple flights), I&#x27;m still developing the IMU code using a lightweight Kalman filter. Additionally, there isn&#x27;t yet a wide network of Horus Binary decoding stations like the APRS network has (I-gates), but I hope that by promoting this protocol, more stations will pop up. This means that if you&#x27;re not in an area with many receive stations, you&#x27;ll need to set up your own using either Horus-GUI (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;projecthorus&#x2F;horus-gui\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;projecthorus&#x2F;horus-gui</a>) or horusdemodlib (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;projecthorus&#x2F;horusdemodlib\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;projecthorus&#x2F;horusdemodlib</a>).<p>One issue I’m still working on is improving RF signal strength. Although the protocol is decodable in very low-noise environments, the transmit power appears to be lower than that of a typical radiosonde. This could be due to several factors: limited current on a weak power source (signal is stronger when powered from a bench supply), off-tuned filtering&#x2F;matching, or not paying enough attention to the antenna. I&#x27;m planning to run more simulations to figure this out. That said, the signal is still decodable from the ground even at max altitude (~100,000 feet).<p>On the more technical side, Tiny4FSK uses:\n- the SAMD21 microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU\n- the TPS61200 boost converter, which is adjusted to output 3.3v\n- Si4063 radio module, which I use on the 70cm band\n- ATGM336H gps module - pretty cheap GPS module which works in airborne mode (&gt;18km)\n- integrated BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor\nThe code uses the Arduino framework to make it accessible to beginners.<p>All flights using Horus Binary v2, including reprogrammed radiosondes, other custom trackers, and Tiny4FSK show up in real-time on Sondehub Amateur (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amateur.sondehub.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amateur.sondehub.org</a>). Flight data can be found in the &#x2F;Media&#x2F;Data folder on Github (there&#x27;s several missing flights on there though).<p>Thanks for reading, hope I didn’t mess anything up too badly in the post!\n-Max",

Just add a couple of Python decorators to your OpenAI agent code, run Temporal workers and you&#x27;re ready to go.<p>Check the video I did with OpenAI showing this in action (it&#x27;s linked in the repo).<p>OpenAI actually use us for ChatGPT Images and also their Codex code writing agent so I figure this may be a viable path for others to code something easy that&#x27;s also reliable at scale.<p>Happy to answer questions.",
