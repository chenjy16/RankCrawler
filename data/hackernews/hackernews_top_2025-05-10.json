We just launched nao, an AI code editor to work with data: a local editor, directly connected with your data warehouse, and powered by an AI copilot with built-in context of your data schema and data-specific tools.<p>See our demo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU</a><p>Writing code with LLMs is the new normal in software engineering. But not when it comes to manipulating data. Tools like Cursor don’t interact natively with data warehouses — they autocomplete SQL blindly, not knowing your data schema. Most of us are still juggling multiple tools: writing code in Cursor, checking results in the warehouse console, troubleshooting with an observability tool, and verifying in BI tool no dashboard broke.<p>When you want to write code on data with LLMs, you don’t care much about the code, you care about the data output. You need a tool that helps you write code relevant for your data, lets you visualize its impact on the output, and quality check it for you.<p>Christophe and I have each spent 10 years in data — Christophe was a data engineer and has built data platforms for dozens of orgs, I was head of data and helped data teams building their analytics &amp; data products. We’ve seen how the business asks you to ship data fast, while you’re here wondering if this small line of code will mistakenly multiply the revenue on your CEO dashboard by x5. Which leaves you 2 choices: test extensively and ship slow. Not test and ship fast. That’s why we wanted to create nao: a tool really adapted to our data work, that would allow data teams to ship at business pace.<p>nao is a fork of VS Code, with built-in connectors for BigQuery, Snowflake, and Postgres. We built our own AI copilot and tab system, gave them a RAG of your data warehouse schemas and of your codebase. We added a set of agent tools to query data, compare data, understand data tools like dbt, assess the downstream impact of code in your whole data lineage.<p>The AI tab and the AI agent write straight away code matching your schema, may it be for SQL, python, yaml. It shows you code diffs and data diffs side by side, to visualize what your change did to the data output. And you can leave the data quality checks to the agent: detect missing or duplicated values, outliers, anticipate breaking changes downstream or compare dev and production data differences.<p>Data teams usually use nao for writing SQL pipelines, often with dbt. It helps them create data models, document them, test them, while making sure they’re not breaking data lineage and figures in the BI. In run mode, they also use it to run some analytics, and identify data quality bugs in production. For less technical profiles, it’s also a great help to strengthen their code best practices. For large teams, it ensures that the code &amp; metrics remain well factorized and consistent.<p>Software engineers use nao for the database exploration part: write SQL queries with nao tab, explore data schema with the agent, and write DDL.<p>Question we often get is: why not just use Cursor and MCPs? Cursor has to trigger many MCP calls to get full context of the data, while nao has it always available in one RAG. MCPs stay in a very enclosed part of Cursor: they don’t bring data context to the tab. And they don’t make the UI more adapted to data workflows. Besides, nao comes as pre-packaged for data teams: they don’t have to set up extensions, install and authenticate in MCPs, build CI&#x2F;CD pipelines. Which means even non-technical data teams can have a great developer experience.<p>Our long-term goal is to become the best place to work with data. We want to fine-tune our own models for SQL, Python and YAML to give the most relevant code suggestions for data. We want to enlarge our comprehension of all data stack tools, to become the only agnostic editor for any of your data workflow.<p>You can try it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sunshine.getnao.io&#x2F;releases&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sunshine.getnao.io&#x2F;releases&#x2F;</a> - download nao, sign up for free and start using it. Just for HN Launch, you can create a temporary account with a simple username if you’d prefer not to use your email. For now, we only have Mac version but Linux and Windows are coming.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback — and get your thoughts on how we can improve even further the data dev experience!",

      "text": "Hi HN, Hydra cofounders (Joe and JD) here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hydra.so&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hydra.so&#x2F;</a>)! We enable realtime analytics on Postgres without requiring an external analytics database.<p>Traditionally, this was unfeasible: Postgres is a rowstore database that’s 1000X slower at analytical processing than a columnstore database.<p>(A quick refresher for anyone interested: A rowstore means table rows are stored sequentially, making it efficient at inserting &#x2F; updating a record, but inefficient at filtering and aggregating data. At most businesses, analytical reporting scans large volumes of events, traces, time-series data. As the volume grows, the inefficiency of the rowstore compounds: i.e. it&#x27;s not scalable for analytics. In contrast, a columnstore stores all the values of each column in sequence.)<p>For decades, it was a requirement for businesses to manage these differences between the row and columnstore’s relative strengths, by maintaining two separate systems. This led to large gaps in both functionality and syntax, and background knowledge of engineers. For example, here are the gaps between Redshift (a popular columnstore) and Postgres (rowstore) features: (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;redshift&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;c_unsupported-postgresql-features.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;redshift&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;c_unsupported...</a>).<p>We think there’s a better, simpler way: unify the rowstore and columnstore – keep the data in one place, stop the costs and hassle of managing an external analytics database. With Hydra, events, traces, time-series data, user sessions, clickstream, IOT telemetry, etc. are now accessible as a columnstore right alongside my standard rowstore tables.<p>Our solution: Hydra separates compute from storage to bring the analytics columnstore with serverless processing and automatic caching to your postgres database.<p>The term &quot;serverless&quot; can be a bit confusing, because a server always exists, but it means compute is ephemeral and spun up and down automatically. The database automatically provisions and isolates dedicated compute resources for each query process. Serverless is different from managed compute, where the user explicitly chooses to allocate and scale CPU and memory continuously, and potentially overpay during idle time.<p>How is serverless useful? It&#x27;s important that every analytics query has its own resources per process. The major hurdles with running analytics on Postgres is 1) Rowstore performance 2) Resource contention. #2 is very often overlooked - but in practice, when analytics queries are run they tend to hog resources (RAM and CPU) from Postgres transactional work. So, a slightly expensive analytics query has the ability to slow down the entire database: that&#x27;s why serverless is important: it guarantees the expensive queries are isolated and run on dedicated database resources per process.<p>why is hydra so fast at analytics? (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;hydraDBMS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;hydraDBMS</a>) 1) columnstore by default 2) metadata for efficient file-skipping and retrieval 3) parallel, vectorized execution 4) automatic caching<p>what’s the killer feature? hydra can quickly join columnstore tables with standard row tables within postgres with direct sql.<p>example: “segment events as a table.” Instead of dumping segment event data into a s3 bucket or external analytics database, use hydra to store and join events (clicks, signups, purchases) with user profile data within postgres. know your users in realtime: “what events predict churn?” or “which user will likely convert?” is immediately actionable.<p>Thanks for reading! We would love to hear your feedback and if you&#x27;d like to try Hydra now, we offer a $300 credit and 14-days free per account. We&#x27;re excited to see how bringing the columnstore and rowstore side-by-side can help your project.",

      "text": "Yes, another reactive UI framework for JavaScript. Bear with me, please... :-)<p>I &#x27;invented&#x27; the concept for this back in 2011, and it was used (as a proprietary lib) in various startups. Even though <i>many</i> similar open source libs have been released since, and boy have I tried a lot of them, none have been able to capture the elegance and DX of what we had back then. I might be biased though. :-)<p>So I started creating a cleaned-up, modern, TypeScript, open source implementation for the concept about five years ago. After many iterations, working on the project on and off, I&#x27;m finally happy with its API and the developer experience it offers. I&#x27;m calling it 1.0!<p>The concept: It uses many small, anonymous functions for emitting DOM elements, and automatically reruns them when their underlying proxied data changes. This proxied data can be anything from simple values to complex, typed, and deeply nested data structures.<p>As I&#x27;m currently free to spend my time on labors of love like this, I&#x27;m planning to expand the ecosystem around this to include synchronizing data with a remote server&#x2F;database, and to make CRUD apps very rapid and perhaps even pleasurable to implement.<p>I&#x27;ve celebrated 1.0 by creating a tutorial with editable interactive examples! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aberdeenjs.org&#x2F;Tutorial&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aberdeenjs.org&#x2F;Tutorial&#x2F;</a><p>I would love to hear your feedback.

How do they share that context? Is it via:<p><pre><code>  - A structured memory layer (like a knowledge graph)?\n  - Centralized state in a RAG-backed store?\n  - Something simpler (or messier)?\n</code></pre>\nI’m experimenting with using a shared knowledge graph as memory across agents—backed by RAG for unstructured input, and queryable for planning, dependencies, and task dispatch.<p>Would love to know:<p><pre><code>  - Is anyone else thinking about shared memory across physical agents?\n  - How are you handling world state, task context, or coordination?\n  - Any frameworks or lessons you’ve found helpful?\n</code></pre>\nExploring this space and would really appreciate hearing from others who are building in or around it.<p>Thanks!",

Modern apps rely heavily on third-party APIs (think payment processors, data providers, etc.), but once TLS kicks in, figuring out exactly what data is being sent, identifying PII exposure, or debugging integration issues becomes incredibly difficult without resorting to complex and often brittle solutions.<p>Traditional approaches like forward proxies require terminating TLS (MITM), managing certificates, and often introduce performance bottlenecks or single points of failure. Network firewalls usually operate at L3&#x2F;L4 and lack payload visibility. We felt there had to be a better way.<p>That&#x27;s why we built qtap. It&#x27;s a lightweight agent that uses eBPF to tap into network traffic at the kernel level. The key idea is to hook into common TLS libraries (like OpenSSL) before encryption and after decryption. This gives us deep visibility into the actual request&#x2F;response payloads of HTTPS&#x2F;TLS traffic without needing to terminate the connection or manage certs. Because it leverages eBPF, the performance impact is minimal compared to traditional methods.<p>With qtap, we can now see exactly which external services our apps are talking to, inspect the payloads for debugging or security auditing (e.g., spotting accidental PII leaks), monitor API performance&#x2F;errors for third-party dependencies, and get a much clearer picture of our egress traffic patterns.<p>We&#x27;ve found this approach really powerful for improving reliability and security posture. We&#x27;ve packaged qtap as a Linux Binary, Docker container, and Helm chart for deployment.<p>This is still evolving, but we&#x27;re excited about the potential of using eBPF for this kind of deep, yet non-intrusive, visibility.<p>We&#x27;d love to get the HN community&#x27;s feedback:<p><pre><code>    Do you face similar challenges monitoring encrypted egress traffic?\n    What are your thoughts on using eBPF for this compared to other methods?\n    Any suggestions or potential use cases we haven&#x27;t considered?\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer any questions!",
