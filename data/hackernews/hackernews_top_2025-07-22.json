We’re Jorge and Will from Lotas (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;</a>), and we’ve built an AI coding assistant into RStudio (think Cursor for RStudio).<p>RStudio is used by about 2 million data scientists and academics, but they currently lack a coding assistant within their IDE. Developers in other environments benefit from tools like Cursor and Windsurf, but R users don’t have any equivalent tools to speed up their workflow. Since ~80% of R programmers prefer to use RStudio over other IDEs like VSCode to write R code, we figured a tool like this one could be quite useful.<p>Both of us were PhD students at Harvard. Jorge was in the biophysics program and Will was in the biostatistics program where most people used RStudio every day. We saw how integrated code assistants were taking off in other IDEs, but we noticed that the RStudio integrations were still lagging far behind. Many R users were copying and pasting code from ChatGPT to build their workflows, and this was clearly slow and fragile.<p>To bring the Cursor-like experience to RStudio users, we built Rao (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;</a>): a fork of RStudio with an embedded AI assistant that is aware of the user’s local context (both files and variable environment), can read and write files, can run code or commands, and can interpret textual or visual output. It works with any of the file formats already in RStudio (R, notebooks including RMDs and QMDs, Python, Stan, etc.), allowing R programmers to iteratively perform entire data analyses inside their preferred IDE.<p>Other AI data science tools are either (1) built on the web or in environments people don’t already use, (2) are completely focused on python notebooks, or (3) are weak package-based assistants with limited functionality. Rao is exactly like the RStudio IDE that millions of data scientists already use, but it incorporates a powerful AI assistant and works with all the standard file types.<p>You can download Rao at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;download</a>, watch our demo on the homepage (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;</a>), and work through some example use cases on our GitHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lotas-ai&#x2F;rao&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;demos\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lotas-ai&#x2F;rao&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;demos</a>). We have a one-week free trial (no card required) and provide 500 queries&#x2F;month for $20&#x2F;month after that. We’d love to hear feedback from the HN community to make Rao as useful as possible!\nYou can reach us at founders@lotas.ai.<p>P.S. We have zero data retention (ZDR) agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic, but we currently recommend users do not input sensitive or regulated data like PHI into Rao until we sign BAAs with both model providers.

It’s an MCP server that automatically finds and executes the right tools needed to accomplish your task without having to manage MCP servers for each service (GitHub, Linear, Atlassian, Notion etc.). Once you add it to Cursor (or any other AI app with MCP support), Cursor instantly gets access to a growing library of remote MCP servers without any extra setup. For services that require authentication, you will be asked to login the first time you ask your AI to interact with that service.<p>Two problems we are trying to solve:<p>Friction - Normally if you want to give Cursor access to GitHub, you have to install the right MCP server and login before you can use GitHub with Cursor’s chat. With MCP Jetpack, you can ask Cursor to list your GitHub issues, and it will automatically execute the right tool behind the scenes to accomplish your task. For services that require authentication, you will be asked to login the first time you interact with the service. However, it all happens within the Cursor chat so you never have to context switch and fiddle with Cursor’s settings.<p>Tool Limits - Cursor warns you if you have more than 50 MCP tools installed as it says having more will degrade performance. However, just installing the GitHub MCP server itself adds 74 MCP tools. With MCP Jetpack, you get access to GitHub, Atlassian and 15 other services with just two tools: “FindTool” and “ExecTool”.<p>Here are the 17 services we support today: GitHub, Atlassian, Canva, Linear, Notion, Intercom, Monday.com, Neon, PayPal, Hugging Face, Sentry, Square, Webflow, Wix, Cloudflare Docs, Cloudflare AI Gateway, Cloudflare Workers Bindings.<p>We’ll continue to add more services as companies launch remote MCP servers. If yours isn’t listed and you’d like it to be added, please email us at team@mcpjetpack.com.<p>MCP Jetpack is in alpha so please let us know if you run into any problems or have any feedback - thanks!",

So I built an affordable hosted service starting at $5&#x2F;month. More features and security measurements, zero setup - just bring your SMTP and start sending. You get all the cost savings without any of the self-hosting headaches.<p>Now testing this hosted version at $5&#x2F;month - middle ground between DIY pain and SaaS pricing.\nHosted version: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fertit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fertit.com</a>\nOpen source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rasadov&#x2F;NewsletterManager\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rasadov&#x2F;NewsletterManager</a>\nAnyone else tired of choosing between expensive self-hosting and expensive SaaS?
