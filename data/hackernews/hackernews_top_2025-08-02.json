These are either sent to a local Jaeger (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jaegertracing.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jaegertracing.io&#x2F;</a>) + SQLite backend or to our cloud backend, where we correlate them into a single view. From there, our custom agent takes over.<p>The agent builds a heterogeneous execution tree that merges spans, logs, and GitHub context into one internal structure. This allows it to model the control and data flow of a request across services. It then uses LLMs to reason over this tree - pruning irrelevant branches, surfacing anomalous spans, and identifying likely root causes. You can ask questions like “what caused this timeout?” or “summarize the errors in these 3 spans”, and it can trace the failure back to a specific commit, summarize the chain of events, or even propose a fix via a draft PR.<p>We also built a debugging UI that ties everything together - you explore traces visually, pick spans of interest, and get AI-assisted insights with full context: logs, timings, metadata, and surrounding code. Unlike most tools, TraceRoot stores long-term debugging history and builds structured context for each company - something we haven’t seen many others do in this space.<p>What’s live today:<p>- Python and TypeScript SDKs for structured logs and traces.<p>- AI summaries, GitHub issue generation, and PR creation.<p>- Debugging UI that ties everything together<p>TraceRoot is MIT licensed and easy to self-host (via Docker). We support both local mode (Jaeger + SQLite) and cloud mode. Inspired by OSS projects like PostHog and Supabase - core is free, enterprise features like agent mode multi-tenant and slack integration are paid.<p>If you find it interesting, you can see a demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nb-D3LM0sJM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nb-D3LM0sJM</a><p>We’d love you to try TraceRoot (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traceroot.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traceroot.ai</a>) and share any feedback.

Artificial Societies (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io</a>) lets you simulate your target audience so you can test marketing, messaging and content before you launch them.<p>Here’s a quick product demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c0ce8ab860c044c586c13a24b6c9b391?sid=b7b4e23c-5223-4aad-ae08-b5c704d45aad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c0ce8ab860c044c586c13a24b6c9b391?...</a><p>Marketers always say that half their spend will be wasted - they just don’t know which half. Real-world experiments help, but they’re too slow and expensive to run at scale. So, we’re building simulations that let you test rapidly and cheaply to find the best version of your message.<p>How it works:<p>- We create AI personas based on real-world data from actual individuals, collected from publicly available social media profiles and web sources.<p>- For each audience, we retrieve relevant personas from our database and map them out on an interactive social network graph, which is designed to replicate patterns of social influence.<p>- Once you’ve drafted your message, each experiment runs a multi-agent simulation where the personas react to your content and interact with each other - these take 30s to 2 minutes to run. Then, we then surface results and insights to help you improve your messaging.<p>Our two biggest challenges are accuracy and UI. We’ve tested our performance at predicting how LinkedIn posts perform, and the initial results have been promising. Our model has an R2 of 0.78 and we’ve found that “message spread” in our simulations is the single most important predictor of actual engagements when looking at posts made by the same authors. But there’s a long way to go in generalising these simulations to other contexts, and finding ground truth data for evals. We have some more info on accuracy here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io&#x2F;#accuracy\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;societies.io&#x2F;#accuracy</a><p>In terms of UI, our biggest challenge is figuring out whether the ‘experiment’ form factor is attractive to users. We’ve deliberately focused on this (over AI surveys) as experiments leverage our expertise in social influence and how ideas spread between personas.<p>James and I are both behavioral scientists by training but took different paths to get here. I helped businesses run A&#x2F;B tests to boost sales and retention. Meanwhile, James became a data scientist and, in his spare time, hooked together 33,000 LLM chatbots and wrote a paper about it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfdirect&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;bjop.12764\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfdirect&#x2F;10....</a>). He showed me the simulations and we decided to make a startup out of it.<p>Pricing: Artificial Societies is free to try. New users get 3 free credits and then a two week free trial. Pro accounts get unlimited simulations for $40&#x2F;month. We’re planning on introducing teams later, and enterprise pricing for custom-built audiences.<p>We’d love you to give the tool a try and share your thoughts!",

I realized I had access to some original data from a previous project so I built a dashboard to help me visualize the changes and see for myself.<p>you can filter by neighborhoods, bedrooms, original source where the rentals were posted, and select a timeframe.<p>this is still a work in progress, so apologies in advance for any issues you encounter. I would love any feedback on how to improve it and&#x2F;or what other visualizations i should add. known issues include:<p>- some neighborhoods like Prospect Park will also automatically select other, unrelated, neighborhoods when selected<p>- sometimes even when you filter by 1BR it will also include some 2BR<p>- some units might have been listed on multiple platforms, effectively counting as duplicates",

      "text": "Hi HN,<p>We’re Alex and Kalan, the creators of Pontoon (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pontoon-data&#x2F;Pontoon\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pontoon-data&#x2F;Pontoon</a>). Pontoon is an open-source data export platform that makes it really easy to create data syncs and send data to your enterprise customers. Check out our demo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.storylane.io&#x2F;share&#x2F;onova7c23ai6\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.storylane.io&#x2F;share&#x2F;onova7c23ai6</a> or try it out with docker: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pontoon-data.github.io&#x2F;Pontoon&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quick-start&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pontoon-data.github.io&#x2F;Pontoon&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quick...</a><p>While at our prior roles as data engineers, we’ve both felt the pain of data APIs. We either had to spend weeks building out data pipelines in house or spend a lot on ETL tools like Fivetran (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fivetran.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fivetran.com&#x2F;</a>). However, there were a few companies that offered data syncs that would sync directly to our data warehouse (eg. Redshift, Snowflake, etc.), and when that was an option, we always chose it. This led us to wonder “Why don’t more companies offer data syncs?”. It turns out, building reliable cross-cloud data syncs is difficult. That’s why we built Pontoon.<p>We designed Pontoon to be:<p>- Easily deployed: we provide a single, self-contained Docker image for easy deployment and Docker Compose for larger workloads (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pontoon-data.github.io&#x2F;Pontoon&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quick-start&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pontoon-data.github.io&#x2F;Pontoon&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;quick...</a>)<p>- Support modern data warehouses: we support syncing to&#x2F;from Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Postgres.<p>- Sync cross cloud: sync from BigQuery to Redshift, Snowflake to BigQuery, Postgres to Redshift, etc.<p>- Developer friendly: data syncs can also be built via the API<p>- Open source: Pontoon is free to use by anyone<p>Under the hood, we use Apache Arrow (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arrow.apache.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arrow.apache.org&#x2F;</a>) to move data between sources and destinations. Arrow is very performant - we wanted to use a library that could handle the scale of moving millions of records per minute.<p>In the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:<p>- Adding support for DBT models to make adding data models easier<p>- UX improvements like better error messaging and monitoring of data syncs<p>- More sources and destinations (S3, GCS, Databricks, etc.)<p>- Improve the API for a more developer friendly experience (it’s currently tied pretty closely to the front end)<p>In the longer-term, we want to make data sharing as easy as possible. As data engineers, we sometimes felt like second class citizens with how we were told to get the data we needed -  “just loop through this api 1000 times”, “you probably won’t get rate limited” (we did), “we can schedule an email to send you a csv every day”. We want to change how modern data sharing is done and make it simple for everyone.<p>Give it a try <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pontoon-data&#x2F;Pontoon\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pontoon-data&#x2F;Pontoon</a>.

As engineers, we did not like that. MCP seemed like something you wanted to use to build products and applications yourself, not something to hide behind a closed source application.<p>So we approached the SDK but were pretty dissatisfied with the developer experience (double async loops, lots of boilerplate). We decided to write mcp-use to make our lives easier.<p>mcp-use lets you connect any LLM to any MCP server in just 6 lines of code. We provide a high level abstraction over the official MCP SDK that makes your life easier and supports all the functionalities of the protocol.<p>Demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nL_B6LZAsp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nL_B6LZAsp4</a>.<p>The key abstractions we provide are called MCPClient and MCPAgent.<p>MCPClient takes in a set of server configurations, automatically detects the transport type and creates a background task which handles the stream from&#x2F;to the server.<p>MCPAgent is a combination of the MCPClient, an LLM, and a custom system prompt. It consumes the MCP client by transforming the tools, resources and prompts into model agnostic tools that can be called by the LLM.<p>The library also contains some cool utilities:<p>- secure sandboxed execution of MCP servers (we know the protocol doesn&#x27;t shine for security)<p>- meta-tools that allow the agent to search over available servers and tools (to avoid context flooding) and connect dynamically to the server it needs (you could create the omnipotent agent with this).<p>Some cool things we did with this:\n- write an agent that can use a browser and create&#x2F;read linear tickets updated with latest information on the internet<p>- write an agent that has access to the metrics of our company to automatically create weekly reports.<p>- I connected an agent to an IKEA curtain I hacked an MCP on to adapt the lighting of my room from images of the lighting situation.<p>- recreated am open source claude code like CLI, with full MCP capability but with custom models and BYOK (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcp-use&#x2F;mcp-use-cli\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcp-use&#x2F;mcp-use-cli</a>).<p>We recently crossed 100,000 download and we are used by many organizations, including NASA!<p>We’d love to hear what you think of it, most importantly how we can improve it! We are happy to answer any questions and look forward to your comments.",

We&#x27;re building AgentMail (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentmail.to&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentmail.to&#x2F;</a>), an API to give AI agents their own email inboxes. We’re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.<p>We started building email agents because they can converse with users in their inboxes, automate email-based workflows, and authenticate with third-party applications. Given these unique capabilities, we think email will be a core interface for agents.<p>But we were building on top of Gmail, which was a struggle: poor API support, expensive subscriptions, rate limits, sending limits, GCP Pub&#x2F;Sub, OAuth, crappy keyword search, and an overall terrible developer experience.<p>Gmail and other providers didn’t work for us. So we decided to bite the bullet and build our own.<p>AgentMail is like Gmail, but API-first, with programmatic inbox creation, events over webhooks and websockets, simple API key auth, organization-wide semantic search, structured data extraction, and usage-based pricing that scales with emails sent&#x2F;received.<p>Here’s a demo of building an email agent: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1V7BISeFUTM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1V7BISeFUTM</a>, and here’s a demo of a voice agent with its own email inbox: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eG2fCsRK4RY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eG2fCsRK4RY</a><p>So far AgentMail has been deployed to use cases such as apps with dedicated inboxes for each user, voice agents that receive documents in real time, automated account provisioning and QA testing, cold outbound platforms with thousands of inboxes, automations for processing invoices, and agents that coordinate work with humans and other agents.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

This limitation is a result of their core architecture. By design, SAST tools parse code into a simplistic model like an AST or call graph, which quickly loses context in dynamically typed languages or across microservice boundaries, and limits coverage to only resolving basic call chains. When detecting vulnerabilities they rely on pattern matching with Regex or YAML rules, which can be effective for basic technical classes like (XSS, SQLi) but inadequate for logic flaws that don’t conform to well-known shapes and need long sequences of dependent operations to reach an exploitable state.<p>My co-founder and I saw these limitations throughout our careers in national intelligence and military cyber forces, where we built automated tooling to defend critical infrastructure. We realised that LLMs, with the right architecture, could finally solve them.<p>Vulnerabilities are contextual. What&#x27;s exploitable depends entirely on each application&#x27;s security model. We realized accurate detection requires understanding what&#x27;s supposed to be protected and why breaking it matters. This meant embedding threat modeling directly into our analysis, not treating it as an afterthought.<p>To achieve this, we first had to solve the code parsing problem. Our solution was to build a custom, compiler-accurate indexer inspired by GitHub&#x27;s stack graphs approach to precisely navigate code, like an IDE. We build on the LSIF approach (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev&#x2F;</a>) but replace the verbose JSON with a compact protobuf schema to serialise symbol definitions and references in a binary format. We use language‑specific tools to parse and type‑check code, emitting a sequence of Protobuf messages that record a symbol’s position, definition, and reference information. By using Protobuf’s efficiency and strong typing, we can produce smaller indexes, but also preserve the compiler‑accurate semantic information required for detecting complex call chains.<p>This is why most &quot;SAST + LLM&quot; tools that use AST parsing fail - they feed LLMs incomplete or incorrect code information from traditional parsers, making it difficult to accurately reason about security issues with missing context.<p>With our indexer providing accurate code structure, we use an LLM to perform threat modeling by analyzing developer intent, data and trust boundaries, and exposed endpoints to generate potential attack scenarios. This is where LLMs&#x27; tendency to hallucinate becomes a breakthrough feature.<p>For each potential attack path generated, we perform a systematic search, querying the indexer to gather all necessary context and reconstruct the full call chain from source to sink. To validate the vulnerability we use a Monte Carlo Tree Self-refine (MCTSr) algorithm and a &#x27;win function&#x27; to determine the likelihood that a hypothesized attack could work. Once a finding is above a set practicality threshold it is confirmed as a true positive.<p>Using this approach, we discovered vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-51479 in ONYX (an OSS enterprise search platform) where Curators could modify any group instead of just their assigned ones. The user-group API had a user parameter that should check permissions but never used it. Gecko inferred developers intended to restrict Curator access because both the UI and similar API functions properly validated this permission. This established &quot;curators have limited scope&quot; as a security invariant that this specific API violated. Traditional SAST can&#x27;t detect this. Any rule to flag unused user parameters would drown you in false positives since many functions legitimately keep unused parameters. And more importantly, detecting this requires knowing which functions handle authorization, understanding ONYX&#x27;s Curator permission model, and recognizing the validation pattern across multiple files - contextual reasoning that SAST simply cannot do.<p>We have several enterprise customers using Gecko because it solves problems they couldn&#x27;t address with traditional SAST tools. They&#x27;re seeing 50% fewer false positives on the same codebases and finding vulnerabilities that previously only showed up in manual pentests.<p>Digging into false positives, no static analysis tool will ever achieve perfect accuracy, AI or otherwise. We reduce them at two key points. First, our indexer eliminates any programmatic parsing errors that create incorrect call chains that traditional AST tools are susceptible to. Second, we avoid unwanted LLM hallucinations and reasoning errors by asking specific, contextual questions rather than open-ended ones. The LLM knows which security invariants need to hold and can make deterministic assessments based on the context. When we do flag something, manual review is quick because we provide complete source-to-sink dataflow analysis with proof-of-concept code and output findings based on confidence scores.<p>We’d love to get any feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I’ll be in the comments to respond!",
