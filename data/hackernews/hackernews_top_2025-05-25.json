Recently I was reading about new research on Snack Exercises and how beneficial mini workouts of less than 2mins every so often, during the day are to our body.  So, I decided to build an iOS App for me and others to help with this. The app generates a list of exercises that I need to tick to complete daily or loose my streak. The algorithm takes into account muscle groups and balancing the exercises to hit most main muscles. I also stayed going through all exercises and adding a couple of alternative exercises in case I don&#x27;t feel like the recommended exercise. Since I&#x27;m not a trainer I commissioned professional exercise posture video guides and animations by an exercise expert which I attached to each exercise.<p>I uploaded the app on the app store for free and no ads. If this is something that interests you, I want to hear how you balance a long day on your desk vs exercise.",

The initial version was a very basic prototype which was not available anywhere beyond the GitHub repo. You had to install it as a userscript or load the extension manually.<p>Since then, it remained simple but better, new features include:<p>- Improved accuracy by also using comments to help gauge the topic of discussion and the right keywords.<p>- Published as plugin for more browsers: Chrome, Firefox (including android), and more recently Microsoft Edge.<p>- Support for narrow screens and mobile devices.<p>- Added preference controls.<p>You&#x27;re here because you love interesting HN discussions but they&#x27;re often buried away like hidden gems, so give it a try and let me know what you think.",

      "text": "Hey HN!<p>After years of wrestling with Lodash&#x27;s quirks and bundle size issues, I decided to build something better. SuperUtilsPlus is my attempt at creating the utility library I wish existed.<p>What makes it different?<p>TypeScript-first approach: Unlike Lodash&#x27;s retrofitted types, I built this from the ground up with TypeScript. The type inference actually works the way you&#x27;d expect it to.<p>Sensible defaults: Some of Lodash&#x27;s decisions always bugged me. Like isObject([]) returning true - arrays aren&#x27;t objects in my mental model. Or isNumber(NaN) being true when NaN literally stands for &quot;Not a Number&quot;. I fixed these footguns.<p>Modern JavaScript: Built for ES2020+ with proper ESM support. No more weird CommonJS&#x2F;ESM dance.\nActually tree-shakable: You can import from specific modules (super-utils&#x2F;array, super-utils&#x2F;object) for optimal bundling. Your users will thank you.<p>The best parts IMO:<p>compactNil() - removes only null&#x2F;undefined, leaves falsy values like 0 and false alone<p>differenceDeep() - array difference with deep equality (surprisingly useful)<p>Better random utilities with randomUUID() and randomString()<p>debounce() that actually works how you expect with proper leading&#x2F;trailing options<p>Also genuinely curious - what are your biggest pain points with utility libraries? Did I miss any must-have functions?",

      "text": "DoubleMemory started as an experiment to see if I can somehow automatically save all double cmd + c, as I often do instinctively, so I don&#x27;t need extensions to save links and text into an app, and avoiding flooding the capture history as regular clipboard managers does.<p>My motivation was not to create a read-it-later app, yet it evolved into this unique yet cohesive form of a read-it-later + bookmarking organizer + clipboard manager + card based note-taking app over the last 6 months. It also launches from the menu bar with a shortcut and navigates with keyboard shortcuts. My favorite part is instead of rendering a list of article titles, everything is rendered as pretty preview cards in a translucent Pinterest-like mood board. It also has a nifty iOS app, that will allow you to swipe with your thumbs between articles just like on iOS Safari...<p>Now that Pocket is closing, this is after Instapaper going back to indie and Omnivore and UpNext and numerous others closing over the years. All of these are cloud-hosted services, which got me reflecting: maybe this local-first architecture would be well positioned to build in this space.<p>Here is my not-so-scientific comparison:<p>## Domain<p>$10 vs $1M = 100,000x difference.<p>## Server running cost<p>No servers other than what&#x27;s running by iCloud vs $1M per year = 1mX difference<p>## Platforms<p>Apple only (mac + iphone + ipad) vs Multi platforms (windows, linux, android also supported) = 20X maintenance cost difference<p>## Capturing<p>No browser extensions required v.s. maintain all extensions for various browsers and extension stores = 5x difference<p>## Architecture<p>App receives the link, Apple generates the rich preview cards for thousands of different types of links, app caches these preview cards. \nvs.\nSomeone write some custom code for each link type or with Open Graph, one designer created one generic card that works for all links.\n=\n100x cost difference.<p>I know, Apple is coming for clipboards with more restrictions, which is basically a shared global state on Mac systems, DoubleMemory does also support other ways to capture: drag-n-drop to app&#x2F;menubar icon&#x2F;app icon, right click-&gt;Services menu, or Share sheet. We will add more auto-importers.<p>Also vibe coded some importers for Pocket, Omnivore and ReadWise here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doublememory.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doublememory.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;tools</a><p>Everything in the app is free with no limits. Capturing is really step 0. You giving us a chance to save your content, doesn&#x27;t mean you are getting any values out of it (ain&#x27;t that the typical story of read-it-later apps? save-it and never-read-it). the eventual goal is to easily retrieve these content, and eventually consuming them. I hope to eventually launch paid features that aligns with these value generating workflows.<p>App Store link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;doublememory&#x2F;id6737529034\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;doublememory&#x2F;id6737529034</a><p>Let me know what you think...",

While stuck on the couch, I figured I’d put the downtime to good use and finally build a side project I’d been thinking about for a while. So I put together an MVP and decided to release it publicly to gather feedback.<p>I have always struggle to grasp how people are adopting technology and what&#x27;s really hype or under the radar. As tech leader you also often want to know if your tech choices are the right one but it&#x27;s hard to take a data driven solution. And as open-source lover I always want to know how my favorite projects are built.<p>All the data is pulled and refreshed weekly from GitHub, stored on ClickHouse [2] but you can directly check how I built it in the website [3]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstack.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstack.dev</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstack.dev&#x2F;tech&#x2F;clickhouse\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstack.dev&#x2F;tech&#x2F;clickhouse</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstack.dev&#x2F;specfy&#x2F;getstack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstack.dev&#x2F;specfy&#x2F;getstack</a>",
