No warning, no notification, just gone.<p>Naturally, people thought this was a new policy.<p>So they asked support.<p>And here’s where it gets batshit: Cursor has a support email, so users emailed them to find out. The support peson told everyone this was “expected behavior” under their new login policy.<p>One problem. There was no support team, it was an AI designed to &#x27;mimic human responses&#x27;<p>That answer, totally made up by the bot, spread like wildfire.<p>Users assumed it was real (because why wouldn’t they? It&#x27;s their own support system lol), and within hours the community was in revolt. Dozens of users publicly canceled their subscriptions, myself included. Multi-device workflows are table stakes for devs, and if you&#x27;re going to pull something that disruptive, you&#x27;d at least expect a changelog entry or smth.<p>Nope.<p>And just as people started comparing notes and figuring out that the story didn’t quite add up… the main Reddit thread got locked. Then deleted. Like, no public resolution, no real response, just silence.<p>To be clear: this wasn’t an actual policy change, just a backend session bug, and a hallucinated excuse from a support bot that somehow did more damage than the bug itself.<p>But at that point, it didn’t matter. People were already gone.<p>Honestly one of the most surreal product screwups I’ve seen in a while. Not because they made a mistake, but because the AI support system invented a lie, and nobody caught it until the userbase imploded.",

      "text": "Hey HN, we’re building mrge (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home</a>), an AI code review platform to help teams merge code faster with fewer bugs. Our early users include Better Auth, Cal.com, and n8n—teams that handle a lot of PRs every day.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pglEoiv0BgY</a><p>We (Allis and Paul) are engineers who faced this problem when we worked together at our last startup. Code review quickly became our biggest bottleneck—especially as we started using AI to code more. We had more PRs to review, subtle AI-written bugs slipped through unnoticed, and we (humans) increasingly found ourselves rubber-stamping PRs without deeply understanding the changes.<p>We’re building mrge to help solve that. Here’s how it works:<p>1. Connect your GitHub repo via our Github app in two clicks (and optionally download our desktop app). Gitlab support is on the roadmap!<p>2. AI Review: When you open a PR, our AI reviews your changes directly in an ephemeral and secure container. It has context into not just that PR, but your whole codebase, so it can pick up patterns and leave comments directly on changed lines. Once the review is done, the sandbox is torn down and your code deleted – we don’t store it for obvious reasons.<p>3. Human-friendly review workflow: Jump into our web app (it’s like Linear but for PRs). Changes are grouped logically (not alphabetically), with important diffs highlighted, visualized, and ready for faster human review.<p>The AI reviewer works a bit like Cursor in the sense that it navigates your codebase using the same tools a developer would—like jumping to definitions or grepping through code.<p>But a big challenge was that, unlike Cursor, mrge doesn’t run in your local IDE or editor. We had to recreate something similar entirely in the cloud.<p>Whenever you open a PR, mrge clones your repository and checks out your branch in a secure and isolated temporary sandbox.  We provision this sandbox with shell access and a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server. The AI reviewer then reviews your code, navigating the codebase exactly as a human reviewer would—using shell commands and common editor features like &quot;go to definition&quot; or &quot;find references&quot;. When the review finishes, we immediately tear down the sandbox and delete the code—we don’t want to permanently store it for obvious reasons.<p>We know cloud-based review isn&#x27;t for everyone, especially if security or compliance requires local deployments. But a cloud approach lets us run SOTA AI models without local GPU setups, and provide a consistent, single AI review per PR for an entire team.<p>The platform itself focuses entirely on making <i>human</i> code reviews easier. A big inspiration came from productivity-focused apps like Linear or Superhuman, products that show just how much thoughtful design can impact everyday workflows. We wanted to bring that same feeling into code review.<p>That’s one reason we built a desktop app. It allowed us to deliver a more polished experience, complete with keyboard shortcuts and a snappy interface.<p>Beyond performance, the main thing we care about is making it easier for humans to read and understand code. For example, traditional review tools sort changed files alphabetically—which forces reviewers to figure out the order in which they should review changes. In mrge, files are automatically grouped and ordered based on logical connections, letting reviewers immediately jump in.<p>We think the future of coding isn’t about AI replacing humans—it’s about giving us better tools to quickly understand high-level changes, abstracting more and more of the code itself. As code volume continues to increase, this shift is going to become increasingly important.<p>You can sign up now (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrge.io&#x2F;home</a>). mrge is currently free while we&#x27;re still early. Our plan for later is to charge closed-source projects on a per-seat basis, and to continue giving mrge away for free to open source ones.<p>We’re very actively building and would love your honest feedback!",

It&#x27;s designed to work for any microcontroller&#x2F;processor architecture, you build from the bit level upwards so there aren&#x27;t any assumptions around word widths, instruction formats, or endianness.<p>I created Torque initially to write programs for a PIC microcontroller, after running into difficulties with the official assembler. I&#x27;ve also used it to write programs for the Z80 processor inside an old TRS-80 computer.<p>Let me know if you try it out or have any questions!",

      "text": "Hello HN! Particle News product engineer here.<p>Keeping up with the news is overwhelming in an age of information overload. Particle reimagines the experience by organizing articles into comprehensive &quot;Stories,&quot; offering clear, concise summaries to quickly grasp what matters. Today, we reached the #1 spot in &quot;Newspapers &amp; Magazine&quot; on the iOS App Store—and I thought I&#x27;d share a bit of our backstory.<p>I&#x27;ve been connected to this team for a long time. About 20 years ago, I shared a house with our CTO and co-founder Marcel Molina. I helped him get started with programming. Since then, Marcel has had an extraordinary career—becoming a senior staff engineer at Twitter, where he helped build foundational features like Retweets, Notifications, and Lists, and later working at Tesla on manufacturing execution systems that scaled across Gigafactories.<p>At Twitter, Marcel worked closely with our CEO and product visionary Sara Beykpour, who led initiatives like Twitter Blue, Twitter Video, and the experimental app <i>twttr</i>. Sara has a background in Software Engineering and Cognitive Science from the University of Waterloo and spent over a decade at Twitter in engineering and leadership roles.<p>In late 2022, Sara and Marcel started prototyping a news app that could reduce the cognitive and emotional burden of staying informed—by using AI to help people understand more, faster. They were soon joined by a few other former Twitter colleagues who helped shape the early concept into a working iOS application.<p>I joined about 15 months ago to contribute across the entire stack. Since then, I&#x27;ve helped design and build major iOS features, rewritten our public website on Cloudflare Workers, and implemented new functionality in our Go backend, which is driven by Google Cloud&#x27;s Pub&#x2F;Sub architecture.<p>What Makes Particle News Different<p>Particle helps you navigate the news effortlessly—leveraging AI to help you understand more, faster. Some highlights:<p>• Personalized News – Your feed is tailored to your interests. You can follow specific people, places, and things so you never miss what matters to you.<p>• Clear Summaries – Get a quick overview or dive deeper with detailed, structured context—summarized in natural language.<p>• Perspective Tools – Features like &quot;Opposite Sides&quot; and our political spectrum chart let you explore stories through multiple lenses.<p>• Interactive Q&amp;A – Ask questions about any story and get concise answers with sources and citations.<p>• Audio Summaries – Use the &quot;Play&quot; feature to listen to your feed, specific stories, or even select articles—great for hands-free or on-the-go moments.<p>One of the things we&#x27;re most proud of is how Particle supports publishers. We&#x27;ve partnered with outlets like Reuters, AFP, and Fortune to host some of their content via APIs. These partners get prominent placement, and their links are highlighted in gold to stand out. This model aims to drive traffic back to publishers and reward high-quality journalism, rather than just aggregating and commodifying it.<p>Transparency is a core value: all sources are cited, generated answers are grounded in evidence, and we take real care to prevent AI hallucinations or misleading summaries.<p>Despite negligible marketing spend, Particle has grown to the top of its category by focusing on engagement with early users and meaningful partnerships with the media ecosystem.<p>Coming soon: weekday mini crosswords—a new feature designed by another longtime friend of ours from 20 years back who went on to work at Twitter, lead development on Firewatch, and release his own games independently.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly fun and rewarding to be building something meaningful with old and new friends. I feel lucky every day to work alongside some of the best product, design, and engineering minds on a project we hope will help people stay engaged with democracy without burning out.",

I&#x27;ve searched around for a while and i cant find anything like that that can handle thousands of people streaming. The closest is probably Webrtc and that looks like it can only handle 500~ peers.<p>I was thinking most people nowaday have at least 30mbps upload and a 1080p stream only needs ~10mbps and 720p needs ~5ish. Also i think it wouldnt have to be live, people would definitely not mind some amount of lag. I was thinking the big O for packets propagating out in the network should be Log(N) since if a master is sharing the content then is connected to 10 slaves, then those connected to 10 other slaves and so on.<p>The other limitation I could think of is prioritizing who gets the packets first since there&#x27;s a lot of people with 1gbs connections or &gt;10mbps connections. Also deprioritizing leechers to keep it from degrading the stream.<p>Does anyone have knowledge on why it isn&#x27;t a thing still though? it&#x27;s super easy to find streams on websites but they&#x27;re all 360p or barely load. I saw the original creator of bittorrent was creating something like this over 10 years ago and seems to be a dead project. Also this is ignoring the huge time commitment it would take to program something like this. I want to know if this is technically possible to have streams of lets say 100,000 people and why or why not.<p>Just some thoughts, thanks in advance!",
