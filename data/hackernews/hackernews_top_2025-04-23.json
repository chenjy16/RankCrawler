We’re Arjun, Ramnique, and Akhilesh, and we are building Rowboat  (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;</a>), an AI-assisted IDE for building and managing multi-agent systems. You start with a single agent, then scale up to teams of agents that work together, use MCP tools, and improve over time - all through a chat-based copilot.<p>Our repo is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rowboatlabs&#x2F;rowboat\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rowboatlabs&#x2F;rowboat</a>, docs are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rowboatlabs.com&#x2F;</a>, and there’s a demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YRTCw9UHRbU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YRTCw9UHRbU</a><p>It’s becoming clear that real-world agentic systems work best when multiple agents collaborate, rather than having one agent attempt to do everything. This isn’t too surprising - it’s a bit like how good code consists of multiple functions that each do one thing, rather than cramming everything into one function.<p>For example, a travel assistant works best when different agents handle specialized tasks: one agent finds the best flights, another optimizes hotel selections, and a third organizes the itinerary. This modular approach makes the system easier to manage, debug, and improve over time.<p>OpenAI’s Agents SDK provides a neat Python library to support this, but building reliable agentic systems requires constant iterations and tweaking - e.g. updating agent instructions (which can quickly get as complex as actual code), connecting tools, and testing the system and incorporating feedback. Rowboat is an AI IDE to do all this. Rowboat is to AI agents what Cursor is to code.<p>We’ve taken a code-like approach to agent instructions (prompts). There are special keywords to directly reference other agents, tools or prompts - which are highlighted in the UI. The copilot is the best way to create and edit these instructions - each change comes with a code-style diff.<p>You can give agents access to tools by integrating any MCP server or connecting your own functions through a webhook. You can instruct the agents on when to use specific tools via ‘@mentions’ in the agent instruction. To enable quick testing, we added a way to mock tool responses using LLM calls.<p>Rowboat playground lets you test and debug the assistants as you build them. You can see agent transfers, tool invocations and tool responses in real-time. The copilot has the context of the chat, and can improve the agent instructions based on feedback. For example, you could say ‘The agent shouldn’t have done x here. Fix this’ and the copilot can go and make this fix.<p>You can integrate agentic systems built in Rowboat into your application via the HTTP API or the Python SDK (‘pip install rowboat’). For example, you can build user-facing chatbots, enterprise workflows and employee assistants using Rowboat.<p>We’ve been working with LLMs since GPT-1 launched in 2018. Most recently, we built Coinbase’s support chatbot after our last AI startup was acquired by them.<p>Rowboat is Apache 2.0 licensed, giving you full freedom to self-host, modify, or extend it however you like.<p>We’re excited to share Rowboat with everyone here. We’d love to hear your thoughts!",

      "text": "Hey HN, we’re Adi and Arnav. A few months ago, we hit a wall trying to get LLMs to answer questions over research papers and instruction manuals. Everything worked fine, until the answer lived inside an image or diagram embedded in the PDF. Even GPT‑4o flubbed it (we recently tried O3 with the same, and surprisingly it flubbed it too). Naive RAG pipelines just pulled in some text chunks and ignored the rest.<p>We took an invention disclosure PDF (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1ySzQgbNZkC5dPLtE3pnnVL2rW_9aTeuG&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1ySzQgbNZkC5dPLtE3pnnVL2rW_9...</a>) containing an IRR‑vs‑frequency graph and asked GPT “From the graph, at what frequency is the IRR maximized?”. We originally tried this on gpt-4o, but while writing this used the new natively multimodal model o4‑mini‑high. After a 30‑second thinking pause, it asked for clarifications, then churned out buggy code, pulled data from the wrong page, and still couldn’t answer the question. We wrote up the full story with screenshots here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.morphik.ai&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;gpt-vs-morphik-multimodal\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.morphik.ai&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;gpt-vs-morphik-multimodal</a>.<p>We got frustrated enough to try fixing it ourselves.<p>We built Morphik to do multimodal retrieval over documents like PDFs, where images and diagrams matter as much as the text.<p>To do this, we use Colpali-style embeddings, which treat each document page as an image and generate multi-vector representations. These embeddings capture layout, typography, and visual context, allowing retrieval to get a whole table or schematic, not just nearby tokens. Along with vector search, this could now retrieve exact pages with relevant diagrams and pass them as images to the LLM to get relevant answers. It’s able to answer the question with an 8B llama 3.1 vision running locally!<p>Early pharma testers hit our system with queries like &quot;Which EGFR inhibitors at 50 mg showed ≥ 30% tumor reduction?&quot; We correctly returned the right tables and plots, but still hit a bottleneck, we weren’t able to join the dots across multiple reports. So we built a knowledge graph: we tag entities in both text and images, normalize synonyms (Erlotinib → EGFR inhibitor), infer relations (e.g. administered_at, yields_reduction), and stitch everything into a graph. Now a single query could traverse that graph across documents and surface a coherent, cross‑document answer along with the correct pages as images.<p>To illustrate that, and just for fun, we built a graph of 100 Paul Graham’s essays here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pggraph.streamlit.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pggraph.streamlit.app&#x2F;</a> You can search for various nodes, (eg. startup, sam altman, paul graham and see corresponding connections). In our system, we create graphs and store the relevant text chunks along with the entities, so on querying, we can extract the relevant entity, do a search on the graph and pull in the text chunks of all connected nodes, improving cross document queries.<p>For longer or multi-turn queries, we added persistent KV caching, which stores intermediate key-value states from transformer attention layers. Instead of recomputing attention from scratch every time, we reuse prior layers, speeding up repeated queries and letting us handle much longer context windows.<p>We’re open‑source under the MIT Expat license: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;morphik-org&#x2F;morphik-core\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;morphik-org&#x2F;morphik-core</a><p>Would love to hear your RAG horror stories, what worked, what didn’t and any feedback on Morphik. We’re here for it.",

The agent will clarify your requirements and either execute the task immediately or generate a plan with step-by-step instructions for you to approve. Once you’re happy with the changes, export everything to GitHub or let the agent provision it in your cloud account. Here’s a quick demo of deploying a new app to GCP &#x2F; AWS:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;4627b3cd96cc439e9981a38363b7f6f7\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;4627b3cd96cc439e9981a38363b7f6f7</a><p>Why build a new coding agent when there are good ones already out there? We believe there’s room for a new agent that is specifically built for DevOps tasks since the risks are much higher – it&#x27;s easy to rollback AI-related errors in a web app, but fixing a misconfigured database is not nearly as easy. By focusing specifically on cloud infra, we can provide all the visibility and checks you need to feel confident in your configuration changes.<p>At our previous jobs, we built an internal data &#x2F; ML platform at Google Life Sciences that involved migrating off of internal Google infrastructure to the public cloud (GCP). We quickly learned how complicated it can be to configure cloud infrastructure well, even for seemingly simple tasks. Configuring an app with CI&#x2F;CD requires knowledge of multiple infra tools, cloud services, and best practices. Mistakes can be costly and diagnosing issues can send you down a rabbit hole of cloud docs.<p>Our goal is to help engineers feel confident when making changes in their cloud. We designed the workflow to start with a prompt, a template, or a GitHub repository. After clarifying your requirements, the agent will start generating IaC, CI&#x2F;CD, and other configurations using the latest docs, public Terraform Registries, and a set of best practices we dynamically load into the context window.<p>All changes are run through static analysis to detect hallucinations, estimate cost changes, and visualize your infrastructure components as you go. Once you’re happy with the changes, you can export everything to GitHub for review. You also have the option to deploy directly to your cloud from the workspace and let the agent diagnose any deployment issues. The deployment flow is &quot;pseudo-deterministic&quot; in that it follows a checklist of human-guided instructions that help it stay in bounds, but we still recommend only using this feature for dev environments and using GitOps for any changes to production.<p>The current plan is to continue adding support for more tools (Kubernetes and GitLab are next) and we may add a CLI that lets you bring the agent into your local workspace.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback and ideas!",

Recently I revamped the whole stack, iterated on that feedback and made our project fully open-source—all of the client, hardware, firmware code.<p>This Github repo turns an ESP32-S3 into a realtime AI speech companion using the OpenAI Realtime API, Arduino WebSockets, Deno Edge Functions, and a full-stack web interface. You can talk to your own custom AI character, and it responds instantly.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find a resource that helped set up a reliable, secure websocket (WSS) AI speech to speech service. While there are several useful Text-To-Speech (TTS) and Speech-To-Text (STT) repos out there, I believe none gets Speech-To-Speech right. OpenAI launched an embedded-repo late last year which sets up WebRTC with ESP-IDF. However, it&#x27;s not beginner friendly and doesn&#x27;t have a server side component for business logic.<p>This repo is an attempt at solving the above pains and creating a great speech to speech experience on Arduino with Secure Websockets using Edge Servers (with Deno&#x2F;Supabase Edge Functions) for fast global connectivity and low latency.",

We’re launching Magic Patterns (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com</a>), an AI prototyping tool that helps PMs and designers create functional, interactive designs and websites. There’s a demo video at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SK8C_tQBwIU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SK8C_tQBwIU</a>, as well as video walkthroughs of specific examples at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;video-tutorials\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;v...</a><p>While other tools help with “AI-assisted coding,” we have been quietly focused on “AI-assisted designing.” With Magic Patterns you can visually communicate your idea, get hands on feedback from customers, and test new features.<p>Teddy and I are best friends and former frontend engineers turned founders. We arrived at Magic Patterns after several pivots—always in the design tooling space, but different products that all struggled to get usage. We started working on Magic Patterns after an internal hackathon. Teddy built a UI library catalog and I messed around with GPT 3.5. We thought it’d be fun to combine the two: an AI component generator. Describe whatever you want, and get back a React component!<p>That started to take off and we gained users, but it wasn’t developers using the tool. Instead, it was PMs, designers, and leadership who could finally communicate their ideas. They use it to test new ideas quickly, get feedback from customers, and improve communication with internal teams. Also, hobbyists (and programmers who aren’t designers) use us to create designs and UIs that they wouldn’t be able to otherwise.<p>We use Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, and leverage a fine-tuned model for fast-applying edits. The most challenging part is determining the most relevant context to feed to the LLM. We attempt to solve this with our click to update feature and by letting users define a brand preset, or default prompt.<p>Unlike other tools in this space, we’re specifically focused on (1) product teams—we&#x27;re realtime and collaborative; and (2) frontend only—we don&#x27;t spin up a database or backend because we aren&#x27;t solving &quot;idea to fullstack app.&quot;<p>A common workflow is a product manager building an interactive prototype and then passing it off to a designer for more polish or directly to engineers. Many teams are even skipping Figma entirely now, telling us that it feels like an unnecessary middleman. Teams are instead generating clickable prototypes, collaborating directly with stakeholders, and using that as the mockup.<p>With Magic Patterns, you can: - Collaborate with your team on our infinite canvas; - Match your existing designs by creating reusable components directly; - Brainstorm features and flows. (The latter is what we use it for internally.)<p>We started as a way to build small, custom components, but now people are one-shotting entire\nwebsites and hosting them with us, or building dashboards that they share internally or in customer demos. People have sold $10k&#x2F;mo contracts with Magic Patterns designs!<p>Small business owners—everyone from fishermen to driving instructors to hotel managers—are using us to build their websites and then hosting them with us. Example sites built by Magic Patterns include <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdealflow.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdealflow.ai&#x2F;</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinringo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinringo.com&#x2F;</a>. It’s amazing how people who couldn’t have done that before are now able to, and super gratifying to us to be empowering people in this way.<p>You can get started with our docs here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;introduction\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;get-started...</a>, and you can try the actual product. Simply go to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com</a> and prompt for any UI you want.<p>Today no login is required, just click “Coming from Hackernews?” and you’ll get 5 messages free to try. Once you hit the limit, you’ll then be prompted to login. Plans start at $19&#x2F;mo for another 100 messages a month (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com&#x2F;pricing\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.magicpatterns.com&#x2F;pricing</a>).<p>We’re stoked to be sharing with HN today and are open to all feedback!",

But it turned out their code has several leaky abstractions, which made it hard to override core behavior cleanly. Shortly after, OpenAI introduced breaking changes. Maintaining my customizations on top became increasingly difficult.<p>So I rewrote the whole thing from scratch using Python. My version is designed to support local LLMs.<p>Right now, it only works with phi-4-mini (GGUF) via lmstudio-community&#x2F;Phi-4-mini-instruct-GGUF, but I plan to support more models. Everything is structured to be extendable.<p>At the moment I only support single-shot mode, but I intend to add interactive (chat mode), function calling, and more.<p>You can install it using Homebrew:<p><pre><code>   brew tap codingmoh&#x2F;open-codex\n   brew install open-codex\n\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s also published on PyPI:<p><pre><code>   pip install open-codex\n\n</code></pre>\nSource: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codingmoh&#x2F;open-codex\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codingmoh&#x2F;open-codex</a>",
