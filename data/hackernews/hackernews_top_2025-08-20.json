      "text": "Hi HN, we are Zaid, Muhammad and Hammad, the co-founders of Uplift AI (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upliftai.org\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upliftai.org</a>). We build models that speak underserved languages — today: Urdu, Sindhi, and Balochi.<p>A billion people worldwide can&#x27;t read. In countries like Pakistan – the 5th most populous country – 42% of adults are illiterate. This holds back the entire economy: patients can&#x27;t read medical reports, parents can&#x27;t help with homework, banks can&#x27;t go fully digital, farmers can&#x27;t research best practices, and people memorize smartphone app button sequences. Voice AI interfaces can fix all of this, and we think this will perhaps be one of the great benefits of modern AI.<p>Right now, existing voice models barely work for these languages, and big tech is moving slowly.<p>Uplift AI was originally a side project to make datasets for translation and voice models. For us it was a &quot;cool side-thing&quot; to work on, not an &quot;important full-time thing&quot; to work on. With some initial data we hacked together a Urdu Voice Bot on Whatsapp and gave it to one domestic worker. In two days 800 people were using it. When we dived deeper into understanding the users, we learned that text interfaces don&#x27;t work for sooo many. So we started Uplift AI to solve this problem fulltime.<p>The most challenging part is that all the building blocks needed for great voice models are broken for these languages. For example, if you are creating a speech synthesis model, you will scrape a lot of data from youtube and auto-label it using a transcription model… all very easy to do in English. But it doesn&#x27;t work in under-served languages because the transcription modes are not accurate.<p>There are many other challenges. Like when you hire human transcribers to label the data, often they don&#x27;t have any spell correctors for their languages, and this creates lots of noise in the data… making it hard to train models with low data.  There are many more challenges in phonemes, silence detection, diacritization etc.<p>We solve these problems by making great internal tooling to help with data labeling. Also, we source our own data and don&#x27;t buy it. This is counterintuitive, but a big advantage over companies buying data and then training. By sourcing our own data we create the right data distributions and get much better models with much less data.  By doing the entire thing inhouse, (data, labeling, training, deploying) we are able to make a lot faster progress.<p>Today we publicly offer a text to speech APIs for Urdu, Sindhi, and Balochi. Here&#x27;s a video which shows this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;dcd5020967444c228e9c127151e7a9f5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;dcd5020967444c228e9c127151e7a9f5</a>.<p>Khan Academy is using our tech to dub videos to Urdu (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ur.khanacademy.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ur.khanacademy.org</a>).<p>Our models excel at informational use cases (like AI bots) but need more work in emotive use-cases like poetry.<p>We have been giving a lot of people private access in beta mode, and today are launching our models publicly. We believe this will be the fastest way for us to learn about areas that are not performing well so we can fix them quickly.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear from all of you, especially around your experiences with under-served languages (not just the Pakistani ones we&#x27;re starting with) and your comments in general.",

ChatGPT had launched,  and we were all figuring out what this technology was and how to make it useful. Developers were using retrieval to bring their data to the models - and so I DM’d every person who had tweeted about “embeddings” in the entire month of December. (it was only 120 people!) I saw then how AI was going to need to search to all the world’s information to build useful and reliable applications.<p>Anton Troynikov and I started Chroma with the beliefs that:<p>1. AI-based systems were way too difficult to productionize<p>2. Latent space was incredibly important to improving AI-based systems (no one understood this at the time)<p>On Valentines Day 2023, we launched first version of Chroma and it immediately took off. Chroma made retrieval just work. Chroma is now a large open-source project with 21k+ stars and 5M monthly downloads, used at companies like Apple, Amazon, Salesforce, and Microsoft.<p>Today we’re excited to launch Chroma Cloud - our fully-managed offering backed by an Apache 2.0 serverless database called Chroma Distributed.  Chroma Distributed is written in Rust and uses object-storage for extreme scalability and reliability. Chroma Cloud is fast and cheap. Leading AI companies such as Factory, Weights &amp; Biases, Propel, and Foam already use Chroma Cloud in production to power their agents. It brings the “it just works” developer experience developers have come to know Chroma for - to the Cloud.<p>Try it out and let me know what you think!<p>— Jeff",

We’re building governance infrastructure that lets hospitals safely evaluate and monitor clinical AI at scale.<p>Hospitals are racing to adopt AI. More than 2,000 clinical AI tools hit the U.S. market last year - from ambient scribes to imaging models. But new regulations (HTI-1, Colorado AI Act, California SB 3030, White House AI Action Plan) require auditable proof that these models are safe, fair, and continuously monitored.<p>The problem is, most hospital IT teams can’t keep up. They can’t vet every vendor, run stress tests, and monitor models 24&#x2F;7. As a result, promising tools die in pilot hell while risk exposure grows.<p>We saw this firsthand while deploying AI at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, so we built Parachute. Columbia is now using it to track live AI models in production.<p>How it works: First, Parachute evaluates vendors against a hospital’s clinical needs and flags compliance and security risks before a pilot even begins. Next, we run automated benchmarking and red-teaming to stress test each model and uncover risks like hallucinations, bias, or safety gaps.<p>Once a model is deployed, Parachute continuously monitors its accuracy, drift, bias, and uptime, sending alerts the moment thresholds are breached. Finally, every approval, test, and runtime change is sealed into an immutable audit trail that hospitals can hand directly to regulators and auditors.<p>We’d love to hear from anyone with hospital experience who has an interest in deploying AI safely. We look forward to your comments!",

We’re Max and Peyton from The Interface (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinterface.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinterface.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>We started out building an AI agent dev tool, but somewhere along the way it turned into Sims for AI agents.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sRPnX_f2V_c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sRPnX_f2V_c</a>.<p>The original idea was simple: make it easy to create AI agents. We started with Jupyter Notebooks, where each cell could be callable by MCP—so agents could turn them into tools for themselves. It worked well enough that the system became self-improving, churning out content, and acting like a co-pilot that helped you build new agents.<p>But when we stepped back, what we had was these endless walls of text. And even though it worked, honestly, it was just boring. We were also convinced that it would be swallowed up by the next model’s capabilities. We wanted to build something else—something that made AI less of a black box and more engaging. Why type into a chat box all day if you could look your agents in the face, see their confusion, and watch when and how they interact?<p>Both of us grew up on simulation games—RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Age of Empires, SimCity—so we started experimenting with running LLM agents inside a 3D world. At first it was pure curiosity, but right away, watching agents interact in real time was much more interesting than anything we’d done before.<p>The very first version was small: a single Unity room, an MCP server, and a chat box. Even getting two agents to take turns took weeks. Every run surfaced quirks—agents refusing to talk at all, or only “speaking” by dancing or pulling facial expressions to show emotion. That unpredictability kept us building.<p>Now it’s a desktop app (Tauri + Unity via WebGL) where humans and agents share 3D tile-based rooms. Agents receive structured observations every tick and can take actions that change the world. You can edit the rules between runs—prompts, decision logic, even how they see chat history—without rebuilding.<p>On the technical side, we built a Unity bridge with MCP and multi-provider routing via LiteLLM, with local model support via Mistral.rs coming next. All system prompts are editable, so you can directly experiment with coordination strategies—tuning how “chatty” agents are versus how much they move or manipulate the environment.<p>We then added a tilemap editor so you can design custom rooms, set tile-based events with conditions and actions, and turn them into puzzles or hazards. There’s community sharing built in, so you can post rooms you make.<p>Watching agents collude or negotiate through falling tiles, teleports, landmines, fire, “win” and “lose” tiles, and tool calls for things like lethal fires or disco floors is a much more fun way to spend our days.<p>Under the hood, Unity’s ECS drives a whole state machine and event system. And because humans and AI share the same space in real time, every negotiation, success, or failure also becomes useful multi-agent, multimodal data for post-training or world models.<p>Our early users are already using it for prompt-injection testing, social engineering scenarios, cooperative games, and model comparisons.\nThe bigger vision is to build an open-ended, AI-native sim-game where you can build and interact with anything or anyone. You can design puzzles, levels, and environments, have agents compete or collaborate, set up games, or even replay your favorite TV shows.<p>The fun part is that no two interactions are ever the same. Everything is emergent, not hard-coded, so the same level played six times will play out differently each time.<p>The plan is to keep expanding—bigger rooms, more in-world tools for agents, and then multiplayer hosting. It’s live now, no waitlist. Free to play. You can bring your own API keys, or start with $10 in credits and run agents right away: www.TheInterface.com.<p>We’d love feedback on scenarios worth testing and what to build next. Tell us the weird stuff you’d throw at this—we’ll be in the comments.",

      "text": "Hi HN! This is Ben from Reality Defender (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com</a>). We build real-time multimodal and multi-model deepfake detection for Fortune 100s and governments all over the world. (We even won the RSAC Innovation Showcase award for our work: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;reality-defender-wins-most-innovative-startup-at-rsa-conference-2024-innovation-sandbox-302137326.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;reality-defender-wi...</a>)<p>Today, we’re excited to share our public API and SDK, allowing anyone to access our platform with 2 lines of code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Back in W22, we launched our product to detect AI-generated media across audio, video, and images: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30766050\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30766050</a><p>That post kicked off conversations with devs, security teams, researchers, and governments. The most common question: &quot;Can we get API&#x2F;SDK access to build deepfake detection into our product?&quot;<p>We’ve heard that from solo devs building moderation tools, fintechs adding ID verification, founders running marketplaces, and infrastructure companies protecting video calls and onboarding flows. They weren’t asking us to build anything new; they simply wanted access to what we already had so they could plug it in and move forward.<p>After running pilots and engagements with customers, we’re finally ready to share our public API and SDK. Now anyone can embed deepfake detection with just two lines of code, starting at the low price of free.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Our new developer tools support detection across images, voice, video, and text — with the former two available as part of the free tier. If your product touches KYC, UGC, support workflows, communications, marketplaces, or identity layers, you can now embed real-time detection directly in your stack. It runs in the cloud, and longstanding clients using our platform have also deployed on-prem, at the edge, or on fully airgapped systems.<p>SDKs are currently available in Python, Java, Rust, TypeScript, and Go. The first 50 scans per month are free, with usage-based pricing beyond that. If you’re working on something that requires other features or streaming access (like real-time voice or video), email us directly at yc@realitydefender.com<p>Much has changed since 2022. The threats we imagined back then are now showing up in everyday support tickets and incident reports. We’ve witnessed voice deepfakes targeting bank call centers to commit real-time fraud; fabricated documents and AI-generated selfies slip through KYC and IDV onboarding systems; fake dating profiles, AI-generated marketplace sellers, and “verified” influencers impersonating real people. Political disinformation videos and synthetic media leaks have triggered real-world legal and PR crises. Even reviews, support transcripts, and impersonation scripts are increasingly being generated by AI.\nDetection remains harder than we first expected since we began in 2021. New generation methods emerge every few weeks that invalidate prior assumptions. This is why we are committed to building every layer of this ourselves. We don’t license or white-label detection models; everything we deploy is built in-house by our team.<p>Since our original launch, we’ve worked with tier-one banks, global governments, and media companies to deploy detection inside their highest-risk workflows. However, we always believed the need wasn’t limited to large institutions, but everywhere. It showed up in YC office hours, in early bug reports, and in group chats after our last HN post.<p>We’ve taken our time to make sure this was built well, flexible enough for startups, and battle-tested enough to trust in production. The API you can use today is the same one powering many of our enterprise deployments.<p>Our goal is to make Reality Defender feel like Stripe, Twilio, or Plaid — an invisible, trusted layer that you can drop into your system to protect what matters. We feel deepfake detection is a key component of critical infrastructure, and like any good infrastructure, it should be modular, reliable, and boring (in the best possible way).<p>Reality Defender is already in the Zoom marketplace and will be on the Teams marketplace soon. We will also power deepfake detection for identity workflows, support platforms, and internal trust and safety pipelines.<p>If you&#x27;re building something where trust, identity, or content integrity matter, or if you’ve run into weird edge cases you can’t explain, we’d love to hear from you.<p>You can get started here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realitydefender.com&#x2F;api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realitydefender.com&#x2F;api</a><p>Or you can try us for free two different ways:<p>1) 1-click add to Zoom &#x2F; Teams to try in your own calls immediately.<p>2) Email us up to 50 files at yc@realitydefender.com and we’ll scan them for you — no setup required.<p>Thanks again to the HN community for helping launch us three years ago. It’s been a wild ride, and we’re excited to share something new. We live on HN ourselves and will be here for all your feedback. Let us know what you think!",

      "text": "Hey HN! Braden here, creator of Whispering, an open-source speech-to-text app.<p>I really like dictation. For years, I relied on transcription tools that were <i>almost</i> good, but they were all closed-source. Even a lot of them that claimed to be “local” or “on-device” were still black boxes that left me wondering where my audio really went.<p>So I built Whispering. It’s open-source, local-first, and most importantly, transparent with your data.   Your data is stored locally on your device, and your audio goes directly from your machine to a local provider (Whisper C++, Speaches, etc.) or your chosen cloud provider (Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.). For me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).<p>Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid, closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office.<p>Here’s an overview: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1jYgBMrfVZs</a>, and here’s how I personally am using it with Claude Code these days: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tpix588SeiQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tpix588SeiQ</a>.<p>There are plenty of transcription apps out there, but I hope Whispering adds some extra competition from the OSS ecosystem (one of my other OSS favorites is Handy <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjpais&#x2F;Handy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjpais&#x2F;Handy</a>). Whispering has a few tricks up its sleeve, like a voice-activated mode for hands-free operation (no button holding), and customizable AI transformations with any prompt&#x2F;model.<p>Whispering used to be in my personal GH repo, but I recently moved it as part of a larger project called Epicenter (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;epicenter-so&#x2F;epicenter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;epicenter-so&#x2F;epicenter</a>), which I should explain a bit...<p>I’m basically obsessed with local-first open-source software. I think there should be an open-source, local-first version of every app, and I would like them all to work together. The idea of Epicenter is to store your data in a folder of plaintext and SQLite, and build a suite of interoperable, local-first tools on top of this shared memory. Everything is totally transparent, so you can trust it.<p>Whispering is the first app in this effort. It’s not there yet regarding memory, but it’s getting there. I’ll probably write more about the bigger picture soon, but mainly I just want to make software and let it speak for itself (no pun intended in this case!), so this is my Show HN for now.<p>I just finished college and was about to move back with my parents and work on this instead of getting a job…and then I somehow got into YC. So my current plan is to cover my living expenses and use the YC funding to support maintainers, our dependencies, and people working on their own open-source local-first projects. More on that soon.<p>Would love your feedback, ideas, and roasts. If you would like to support the project, star it on GitHub here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;epicenter-so&#x2F;epicenter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;epicenter-so&#x2F;epicenter</a>) and join the Discord here (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.epicenter.so&#x2F;discord\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.epicenter.so&#x2F;discord</a>). Everything’s MIT licensed, so fork it, break it, ship your own version, copy whatever you want!",

So, I extended the app to cover these as well.<p>To avoid replacing the scrolling for regular feeds, I also added a feature that shows a pop-up when I&#x27;m overscrolling in any app. It forces me to stop and think for a minute before I continue scrolling.<p>I built it on Android Studio, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the UI. I use the Accessibility Service to detect scrolls and navigate out of them. Unfortunately, this only works for Android. There is no way (as far as I know) to do this on iOS.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts",

The reasoning for why we chose to build a toy TPU specifically is fairly simple:<p>- Building a chip for ML workloads seemed cool\n- There was no well-documented open source repo for an ML accelerator that performed both inference and training<p>None of us have real professional experience in hardware design, which, in a way, made the TPU even more appealing since we weren&#x27;t able to estimate exactly how difficult it would be. As we worked on the initial stages of this project, we established a strict design philosophy: TO ALWAYS TRY THE HACKY WAY. This meant trying out the &quot;dumb&quot; ideas that came to our mind first BEFORE consulting external sources. This philosophy helped us make sure we weren&#x27;t reverse engineering the TPU, but rather re-inventing it, which helped us derive many of the key mechanisms used in the TPU ourselves.<p>We also wanted to treat this project as an exercise to code without relying on AI to write for us, since we felt that our initial instinct recently has been to reach for llms whenever we faced a slight struggle. We wanted to cultivate a certain style of thinking that we could take forward with us and use in any future endeavours to think through difficult problems.<p>Throughout this project we tried to learn as much as we could about the fundamentals of deep learning, hardware design and creating algorithms and we found that the best way to learn about this stuff is by drawing everything out and making that our first instinct. In tinytpu.com, you will see how our explanations were inspired by this philosophy.<p>Note that this is NOT a 1-to-1 replica of the TPU--it is our attempt at re-inventing a toy version of it ourselves.",

Every time I open a new chat with Claude or fire up Copilot, I&#x27;m back to square one explaining my codebase structure.<p>So I built something to fix this. It&#x27;s called In Memoria. Its an MCP server that gives AI tools persistent memory. Instead of starting fresh every conversation, the AI remembers your coding patterns, architectural decisions, and all the context you&#x27;ve built up.<p>The setup is dead simple: `npx in-memoria server` then connect your AI tool. No accounts, no data leaves your machine.<p>Under the hood it&#x27;s TypeScript + Rust with tree-sitter for parsing and vector storage for semantic search. Supports JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript, Python, and Rust so far.<p>It originally started as a documentation tool but had a realization - AI doesn&#x27;t need better docs, it needs to remember stuff. Spent the last few months rebuilding it from scratch as this memory layer.<p>It&#x27;s working pretty well for me but curious what others think, especially about the pattern learning part.
