But since it has a complete Lisp runtime, and a thin wrapper library for Win32 APIs[3], you can certainly do much more with it.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy playing with it as much as I enjoyed building it.<p>And yes, I use StumpWM on the Linux side, by the way.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ianthehenry.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;why-janet&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ianthehenry.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;why-janet&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janet-lang.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janet-lang.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;agent-kilo&#x2F;jw32\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;agent-kilo&#x2F;jw32</a>",

I have a PhD in Civil Engineering, and in my experience reporting was by far the most tedious and mind-numbing part of the job.<p>You’d walk around a site all day taking short notes (maybe, often you&#x27;d rely on memory) and snapping photos, then go to three more sites before finally making it back to the office and try to remember everything you wanted to write. Sometimes you’d fill in gaps from memory or you’d keep it purposefully vague. Reports had to be consistent, branded, and checked by senior engineers. It was a huge time sink across the team.<p>Writing reports was the worst part of the job, so we built Opusense to get rid of it. On-site, users type or dictate short notes (e.g. “rebar exposed east end of slab”), and the tool turns them into full sentences, paragraphs, tables, or photo captions in a report template that matches the firm’s format. You can work offline, and it syncs automatically when back online.<p>Most inspection and reporting tools are built for checklist-style workflows (which is great for home inspections or punch lists), but civil, structural, environmental, or geotechnical engineers usually need freeform notes, not radio buttons.<p>This is a particularly good fit for LLMs because engineering field reports live in a constrained, conventional domain: similar language, repeated structures, and highly standardized content across firms and projects. There’s a lot of redundancy and grunt work, summarizing the same site conditions, formatting repetitive data, translating field notes into polished paragraphs, all of which LLMs handle well with the right prompting and guardrails. We’re not generating arbitrary prose; we’re transforming structured inputs (notes, images, forms) into structured outputs, with firm-defined templates and required fields that minimize the risk of hallucination. When facts matter (e.g. test results or measurements), we keep them grounded in the user’s input, the model doesn’t invent data because there’s nothing for it to invent. This makes it one of those cases where LLMs aren’t just a novelty, they&#x27;re genuinely the best tool for the job.<p>Under the hood, we use a combination of prompt-engineered LLMs and firm-specific formatting rules to get outputs that don’t just sound good, but also look right. We’ve recently added translation features, and we’re iterating quickly based on field feedback. We charge per seat and are deployed at mid size firms, and trialing with some multinational engineering firms who have thousands of reports to file each week. We&#x27;re also starting to see interest from construction managers and developers who do their own internal QA reporting.<p>We don&#x27;t have a self-serve way to try out the product yet, because the way our business works requires templates to be customized by company. But there’s a demo at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u3Pi1iih1_Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u3Pi1iih1_Y</a>, and if you want to poke around the UI yourself, here’s a sample account to log in with:<p><pre><code>  login: hndemo@opusense.com\n  password: OpusenseHacker2025\n</code></pre>\nThe app is available for download on the Apple and Google Play stores. When sample reports are generated, you can log into the web interface to also view them online through our website (www.opusense.com) with the same login credentials.<p>We’d love to hear how others are thinking about tools for field work, reporting, or similar workflows (engineering, architectural, etc.). If you’ve built in this space, or have thoughts on how to improve it, we’re all ears!",

I wanted something that felt immediate—intuitive enough for students, fast enough for hobbyists, and hackable enough for engineers. That’s how Olelo Foil was born.<p>Foil is a browser-based airfoil simulator written in JavaScript using Three.js and WebGL. It lets you interactively explore how airfoils behave under different conditions, all rendered in real time. Right now, it uses simplified fluid models, but I’m working toward integrating Navier-Stokes for more accurate simulations—and I’d love help from anyone interested in fluid dynamics, GPU compute, or numerical solvers.<p>I’m also building Olelo Honua, an educational platform focused on Hawaiian STEM content and digital tools. Foil is one piece of that larger vision—bringing STEM education into the browser with open, accessible tools.<p>Check it out, and if you&#x27;re interested in collaborating (especially on the physics side), I’d love to connect!",

Our goal is to make rolling your own auth so ridiculously easy that you’ll never need one.<p>Here are some YouTube videos explaining how it works (we did make our own video but weren’t happy with it and these videos do a great job):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hFtufpaMcLM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hFtufpaMcLM</a> - a really good overview<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QurjwJHCoHQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QurjwJHCoHQ</a> - also a good overview and dives a little deeper into the code<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RKqHrE0KyeE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RKqHrE0KyeE</a> - short and clear<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Atev8Nxpw7c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Atev8Nxpw7c</a> - with TanStack framework<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n6rP9d3RWo8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n6rP9d3RWo8</a> - a full-on 2 hour tutorial<p>Auth has been a pain point for many developers in the TypeScript ecosystem for a while. Not because there aren’t options but because most fall into 2 buckets: (1) Third-party services like Auth0 which own your user data, lock you into a black-box solution and are often super expensive; or (2) open source libraries like NextAuth that cover the basics but leave you stitching your own solution together from there.<p>For Better Auth. the kick off moment was building a web analytics platform and wanting to add an organization feature - things like workspaces, teams, members, and granular permissions. I assumed there’d be something out there I could plug in to NextAuth (the popular and kind of the only library), but there wasn’t. The only options were to build everything from scratch or switch to a 3rd party auth provider. I even tried hacking together a wrapper around NextAuth to support those features, but it was hacky. That’s when we decided to take a step back and build a proper auth library from the ground up with a plugin ecosystem that lets you start simple and scale as needed. That frustration turned into Better Auth.<p>Better Auth lets you roll your own auth directly on your backend and database, with support for everything from simple auth flows to enterprise-grade systems without relying on 3rd party services.<p>It comes with built-in features for common auth flows, and you can extend it as needed through a plugin ecosystem whether that’s 2FA, passkeys, organizations, multi-session, SSO, or even billing integration with Stripe.<p>Unlike 3rd party auth providers, we’re just a library you install in your own project. It’s free forever, lives entirely in your codebase, and gives you full control. You get all the features you’d expect from something like Auth0 or Clerk plus even more through our plugin system, including things like billing integrations with Stripe or Polar. Most libraries stop at the basics but Better Auth is designed to scale with your needs while keeping things simple when you don’t need all the extras.<p>We’re currently building an infrastructure layer that works alongside the framework to offer features that are hard to deliver as just a library—e.g. an admin dashboard with user analytics, bot&#x2F;fraud&#x2F;abuse detection, secondary session storage, and more. This will be our commercial offering. For this, there’s a waitlist at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.better-auth.build\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.better-auth.build</a>. However, this is only optional infrastructure for teams that need these capabilities. The library is free and open source and will remain so.<p>We’d love your feedback!",

My name&#x27;s Matteo and I&#x27;m currently a SWE @ Twilio.<p>1 day at stand-up the question came up if there was an open source solution to something like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runscope.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runscope.com</a>. I found it super interesting that there was no artillery.io-like YAML&#x2F;DSL solution out there. So I built one.<p>Why i think this is cool:<p>1. Companies today run a ton of microservices for event-driven systems. Asserting on the ingress&#x2F;egress out of a system might not be covered fully by HTTP. I&#x27;ve setup a plugin interface so that I can implement assertions on stuff like file buckets, DBs, queues, etc. in the future.<p>2. I didn&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel. Temporal provides all of the test orchestration, scheduling, persistence, etc. I could ever need. Simply put: A test = A workflow and A step = An activity inside of temporal.<p>3. In the future your AI agent friend could run these tests against your system to make sure there aren&#x27;t any regressions.<p>You can try it out the local version here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rocketship.sh&#x2F;quickstart\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rocketship.sh&#x2F;quickstart</a><p>I think there&#x27;s a ton of potential for this project and I would really appreciate any advice, stars, or better-yet both.",
