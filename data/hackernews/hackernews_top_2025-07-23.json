      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I am Cam, and for the past two years I have been working on Compass, an open-source handheld CNC router that brings computer precision to woodworking while keeping the user directly involved in the process.<p>The idea started as my senior design project at UC Berkeley, with the goal of making a more approachable CNC machine—standard CNC machines are expensive, bulky, and remove you from the tactile “maker” experience. Compass solves that by combining a handheld router with real-time robotic assistance. You move the router roughly along a design path, and Compass uses four optical flow sensors (like in computer mice) and a 3-axis motion system to auto-correct for precision cuts.<p>What is different about Compass:\n- Open source: All plans, firmware, and CAD files are available on GitHub.\n- Affordable: The DIY build costs ~$600 in parts, and I am selling kits for &lt;$800.\n- No external markers: The sensing technology allows for positioning without external markers, so no setup or consumables required.\n- Portable: Fits in a backpack and is not limited by a fixed work envelope.<p>We recently completed our first beta program and have just launched V1 kits for pre-order. You can find more info and the launch video at the listed URL.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;camchaney&#x2F;handheld-cnc\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;camchaney&#x2F;handheld-cnc</a>",

We fix this by running Flux Kontext alongside 4o image gen in the chat, as well as by introducing a precision editor powered by custom models where a user indicates an area to modify and we guarantee that only that area will be modified.<p>Our precision editor is state-of-the-art on image editing in our tests and allows inserting new additional images into the existing image. The latter allows users to insert a logo, product, or face into an image without messing up other parts of the image, and even fix logos and faces that were messed up by 4o. Text editing with the precision edit model is still a work in progress, and we will fix it with the next iteration of that model. We recommend using the chat for editing text for now.<p>Example: Insert UT Austin logo into helicopter ad (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd27o2n10001l704h6865f3u\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd27o2n10001l704h6865f3u</a>)<p>We also always produce multiple variations for image generations and edits, as we think this variety is important for getting exactly what you asked for.<p>Example: Paul Graham in startup heaven (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd23h91c000jky04no5d92uy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd23h91c000jky04no5d92uy</a>)<p>One thing we’re excited about is adding more variation into AI-generated websites, as many website builders all use the same CSS libraries, so many websites end up looking the same. \nWe hope to allow builders and creatives to make truly unique designs in 1&#x2F;10th the time it currently takes with existing tools.<p>Example: Make me a popeyes landing page where the eyes are actually popping out (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd25imtm0001jr046nsag4lu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd25imtm0001jr046nsag4lu</a>)\nExample: A train map with sandwich ingredients replacing subway stops.

We are working on it and have a new custom precision editing model on the way. In the meantime, we’re excited to hear your comments and feedback!",

We’re building a platform for ecommerce merchants to send realtime personalized discounts, optimized with AI (obviously)<p>Demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BCYNCqb4fUc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BCYNCqb4fUc</a>, \nSales Video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WiO1S7RBn-o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WiO1S7RBn-o</a><p>All the big tech companies send personalized discounts - Uber, DoorDash, Google, etc. In fact, I was the product lead overseeing discounts at Uber, so if you’ve gotten a promotion on Uber Rides or Eats, that was our tech. These personalization models often generate &gt;30% more revenue vs. non-personalized discounts (cost-neutral that is), so this is a hugely impactful product.<p>It’s no surprise then that other merchants want to follow suit. Merchants don’t want to waste discounts on customers who would have purchased anyway. Frankly it’s not a new idea to offer a software solution to personalize discounts - plenty of other startups have entered this space with a similar product.<p>The biggest problem with personalizing discounts for mid-size and smaller companies has been that traditionally you rely on ‘explore’ data - data from randomly sending out discounts to a portion of the user base. But this has a lot of problems: merchants need to be large, collecting this data is expensive, training data really should be fresh (so explores should constantly be running), and if you want to try a different discount structure (e.g. BOGO instead of 20% off) you’ll need to run a new explore with the new structure.<p>So what does Promi do differently? We train on regular traffic and simplify the problem by just focusing on conversion rate. If we can accurately predict who is unlikely to convert and which products are unlikely to be bought, we can issue discounts without the fear of burning money on an order that would have happened anyway. One of my major takeaways from my time at Uber was that our model was mostly targeting users who had a low likelihood of converting in a given week. Quantifying how much more likely they were to convert when given a discount via explores was helpful, but not as impactful as understanding starting conversion rate.<p>Side note - It’s been a bit interesting launching an AI company during this hype cycle that isn’t actually using the latest and greatest LLMs. We believe more traditional machine learning still has a lot of value to add. I don’t want to say we won’t use LLMs down the road (there may be some interesting applications for developing additional features), but starting this way has worked out well for us.<p>There have been plenty of other challenges (as with any startup). We’ve had to figure out how to automate integrations when so many websites have custom code. We’ve had to make the model work without rich user data since the majority of website visitors aren’t logged in. A quick note in this one - we can use first party cookies to more or less track the view and transaction history, but we’ve found that one big predictor of conversion is traffic source: whether a visitor is coming from ads, email, direct traffic, google search, etc. That traffic source isn’t something as valuable at Uber (since everyone uses the app), so it’s been a bit of a tradeoff in the types of features that are most impactful.<p>Our model seems to be working well! We have case studies on our website showing the typical revenue and profit lift we see. We currently have tiered pricing with different quotas for the amount of revenue managed by Promi discounts.<p>I’d love to get thoughts from the machine learning experts in this community, though full disclosure I’m the non-technical founder. Let us know what you think!",

The link I’ve shared is to a page on my book’s website where you can download a pdf of the introduction, to give HN readers a taste of what is inside.<p>Right now there is so much worry and concern around technology that I feel like some people—though not the folks here—have forgotten how much fun that code and computation can also be. So I wanted to rekindle some of that sense of wonder.<p>But, as I’ve written elsewhere, this is also the kind of book I wish I had when I was younger and getting interested in computers. I’ve always enjoyed the kinds of writing that talks about computing but in the context of so many other big ideas, especially ones I’ve explored at various points in my own life, from evolution to simulation. And that’s what I tried to do.<p>But while “The Magic of Code” is certainly for a wide audience, and for people who are unfamiliar with programming and code, I’ve also (hopefully!) designed it to be of interest to those who are more expert in this realm, with lots of rabbit holes and strange ideas to pursue. And if there exists a genre of book to explain to outsiders why you love a topic, this is in that genre, for computing and code. I think the HN community will really enjoy it.",

      "text": "I’ve long thought that the Word of the Day was a wasted genre. The goal should be to give you words you can use; to enrich your understanding of words you already know; or at least to use words to tell you something neat about the world.<p>Instead, what you usually get is words that will never be used in conversation, held up as curios. Some examples from Dictionary.com’s daily email: thewless, balladmonger, vagility, contextomy. These words are... not useful.<p>I’ve always thought I could do better. My friend Ben recently created a daily puzzle game, called Bracket City, launched here on HN [1], which I like because it takes about the same amount of time as Wordle but has some of the variety and artistry of a good crossword.<p>Ben agreed to let me write a word of the day for the game’s audience. We’ve collected them all here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words</a>. It’s such a joy to write -- every day, I pay homage to a word I love or use or have newly discovered. I find myself paying more attention to words I encounter, thinking if they deserve a place.<p>It’s also fun for another reason. Many years ago I wrote a blog post, &quot;You’re probably using the wrong dictionary&quot; [2], that made the rounds and actually still finds new readers today. It was about how the modern-day dictionaries we find by default on our iPhones and web browsers are actually kind of bureaucratic and lifeless. Through a writer I love, John McPhee, I rediscovered Webster’s 1913 dictionary, which feels like it was written by a thinking person who loved words. I still consult it all the time. Writing a word of the day has reminded me just how delightful and useful Webster’s old dictionary is -- and reacquainted me with the OED, which I now look to every day, and which I discovered you can access with your library card.<p>Some of my favorite entries so far: sophisticated, twee, gravitas, blockbuster, meteorologist, send, bid. There are more than 175 now -- and more coming once a day, every day, for as long as Bracket City stands.<p>To sign up to see each word of the day as it’s published, go to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words</a>.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43622719\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43622719</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsomers.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dictionary\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsomers.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dictionary</a>",

As serializable objects, they can be sent over the network and persisted. They also provide a clean way to model distributed transactions through composition, and naturally support features like Undo and Redo. These qualities make them a great fit for implementing consistency patterns like Saga in distributed systems.<p>On the performance side, sending a Command involves minimal overhead — only its type and data need to be transmitted. In benchmarks focused on raw throughput (measured using 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 clients in a simple request&#x2F;response scenario), <i>cmd-stream&#x2F;MUS</i> (<i>cmd-stream&#x2F;Protobuf</i>) is about 3x (2.8x) faster than <i>gRPC&#x2F;Protobuf</i>, where <i>MUS</i> is a serialization format optimized for low byte usage. This kind of speedup can make a real difference in high-throughput systems or when you&#x27;re trying to squeeze more out of limited resources.<p>By putting Commands at the transport layer, cmd-stream-go avoids the extra complexity of layering Command logic on top of generic RPC or REST.<p>The trade-offs: it’s currently Go-only and maintained by a single developer.<p>If you’re curious to explore more, you can check out the cmd-stream-go repository (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cmd-stream&#x2F;cmd-stream-go\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cmd-stream&#x2F;cmd-stream-go</a>), see performance benchmarks (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ymz-ncnk&#x2F;go-client-server-benchmarks\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ymz-ncnk&#x2F;go-client-server-benchmarks</a>), or read the series of posts on Command Pattern and how it can be applied over the network (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;f9e53442c85d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;f9e53442c85d</a>).<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts — especially where you think this model could shine, any production concerns, similar patterns or tools you’ve seen in practice.<p>Feel free to reach me as <i>ymz-ncnk</i> on the Gophers Slack or follow <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;cmdstream_lib\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;cmdstream_lib</a> for project updates.",

      "text": "Hey HN! We’re Jorge and Will from Lotas (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;</a>), and we’ve built an AI coding assistant into RStudio (think Cursor for RStudio).<p>RStudio is used by about 2 million data scientists and academics, but they currently lack a coding assistant within their IDE. Developers in other environments benefit from tools like Cursor and Windsurf, but R users don’t have any equivalent tools to speed up their workflow. Since ~80% of R programmers prefer to use RStudio over other IDEs like VSCode to write R code, we figured a tool like this one could be quite useful.<p>Both of us were PhD students at Harvard. Jorge was in the biophysics program and Will was in the biostatistics program where most people used RStudio every day. We saw how integrated code assistants were taking off in other IDEs, but we noticed that the RStudio integrations were still lagging far behind. Many R users were copying and pasting code from ChatGPT to build their workflows, and this was clearly slow and fragile.<p>To bring the Cursor-like experience to RStudio users, we built Rao (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;</a>): a fork of RStudio with an embedded AI assistant that is aware of the user’s local context (both files and variable environment), can read and write files, can run code or commands, and can interpret textual or visual output. It works with any of the file formats already in RStudio (R, notebooks including RMDs and QMDs, Python, Stan, etc.), allowing R programmers to iteratively perform entire data analyses inside their preferred IDE.<p>Other AI data science tools are either (1) built on the web or in environments people don’t already use, (2) are completely focused on python notebooks, or (3) are weak package-based assistants with limited functionality. Rao is exactly like the RStudio IDE that millions of data scientists already use, but it incorporates a powerful AI assistant and works with all the standard file types.<p>You can download Rao at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;download</a>, watch our demo on the homepage (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lotas.ai&#x2F;</a>), and work through some example use cases on our GitHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lotas-ai&#x2F;rao&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;demos\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lotas-ai&#x2F;rao&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;demos</a>). We have a one-week free trial (no card required) and provide 500 queries&#x2F;month for $20&#x2F;month after that. We’d love to hear feedback from the HN community to make Rao as useful as possible!\nYou can reach us at founders@lotas.ai.<p>P.S. We have zero data retention (ZDR) agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic, but we currently recommend users do not input sensitive or regulated data like PHI into Rao until we sign BAAs with both model providers.
